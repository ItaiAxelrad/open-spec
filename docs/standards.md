"Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. CAD software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided\_design](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1617994610082000&usg=AOvVaw2xUywgchPjU-9qASg-lg5f)).

Most companies utilize AutoDesk’s AutoCAD software to produce construction plans and graphical plan sheets for a variety of engineering, planning and surveying projects. The CAD Standards manual is intended to provide guidance in the preparation of AutoCAD drawings (.DWG Files) in a manner that is uniform throughout a company’s various offices and divisions.

This manual is a living document, periodic updates will occur as the software and the needs of the company and its employees change. Every CAD user is encouraged to consult with project managers, senior staff, or the CAD committee whenever questions or issues arise.
