1\. Edit the feature settings for the pressure network. Under the settings tab, right-click on “Pressure  Network” and then select “Edit Feature Settings”.

2\. Right-click the part list you wish to use and select the edit button.

3\. Create and Edit a Parts List  

When using pressure pipes in Civil 3D 2017, new parts have been added. You might want to create  parts lists for different materials since different parts exist for each material.

Set the catalog to the desired material, and then create a new parts list for that material. For example,  PVC contains a fire hydrant, while the others do not.

4\. Two choices for creating a pressure pipe network: (a) Create from Object, (b) Pressure Network  Creation Tools  

a. “Home” ribbon tab > Pipe Network > Create Pressure Network from Object

b. “Home” ribbon tab > Pipe Network > Pressure Network Creation Tools

5\. “Modify” ribbon tab > Pressure Pipe Network > Network Tools > Draw Parts in Profile  

Either select the entire pipe network or select the parts you wish to show in the profile view.  You can also click on a part, then right-click and choose add part to profile view. This is also  available in the right-click menu after selecting a part. Alternatively, use the Pipe Network tab  of the Profile View Properties to turn pipes on and off.  

6\. “Pressure Network” ribbon tab > Add Labels ... or "Home" tab > Add Labels

Different Methods of Editing a Pressure Network  

1\. Using Grips  

a. Plan View

You can edit the allowable deflection in the parts list by editing a pipe.

b. Profile View – You can hot grip the invert, centerline, or crown of a pipe. You can also multi hot-grip grips by holding down shift while selecting the grip.

2\. Using the pressure part properties

3\. Using the Edit Pipe Network Vista.  

4\. Pressure networks allow for plan and profile layout tools during editing.  

• Plan layout tools are the same commands described above in this document under pressure  pipe layout tools.  

• Profile layout tools allow the user to add additional parts as well as change values not  allowed in the part properties, such as slope.

5\. Other Tips, Tricks, and Limitations  

a. In Civil 3D 2017, the program allows the user to change the parts once drawn, in previous  versions this is not available.  

b. In Civil 3D 2018/2019, the user can swap the parts directly from the edit ribbon tab for pressure  networks.  

c. The follow surface command in profile layout tools creates additional vertices to follow the  surface more closely. The program does not allow the user to remove those vertices later, the  user would have to delete the pipe and draw it again.  

d. Use Design Check and Depth Check to analyze the pressure network for open connections and  cover violations.  

e. Drawing pipes and bends in the profile layout tools creates an efficient way to create these  vertical bends.
