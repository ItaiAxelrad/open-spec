## Quality Control

A company should be committed to producing plans, reports, and specifications that lead the industry in terms of quality, appearance, and real world application. To that end, every project will go through a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) review process prior to submittal to clients or municipalities. This section outlines the QA/QC process and the project milestones that will trigger a review.

### Engineering Plans

Reviewed by the CEO at the following milestones:

- 50% Complete: Concept Approval. (Prior to initial municipal submittal). This review is designed to examine the engineering concepts and principals being employed on the project to look for fatal flaws or to redirect the engineer to a more efficient or effective design.
- 90% Complete: Appearance and Constructability. (Prior to final municipal submittal). This review is designed to ensure adherence to CAD standards and to assess the detailed effectiveness of the design.
- Provide 48 hours’ notice to the CEO that his review is required. Submit full size hard copy plans to him directly. In the event the CEO is unavailable to conduct a review, the Engineering Division manager or a peer review by a registered PE is an acceptable substitute.

### Survey Plans and Base Files

- Reviewed by the CEO prior to submission to the client (internal or external) or municipality.
- This review is designed to ensure adherence to CAD standards.
- Provide 48 hours’ notice to the CEO that his review is required. PDF is an acceptable format for submission.

### Planning Documents

- Reviewed by the Planning Division Manager prior to submission to the client (internal or external) or municipality.
- This review is designed to ensure adherence to company standards and compliance with municipal code and client needs.
- Review schedule will occur on a case by case basis. Consult directly with the Planning Division Manager for preferred format and timing of the review.

Prior to any submittal, a QA/QC folder should be created in the project Submittal folder to record the revisions required by the project manager. Save all QA/QC drawings and redlines in this folder.

## Electronic Transmittal

The Electronic Transmittal function (eTransmit) should be used whenever you are sending drawings to an entity outside of the Company/Corporation. This feature bundles drawings and xrefs into a compressed folder that can be readily emailed. The procedure for eTransmit is as follows:

1. Command line: `ETRANSMIT`.
2. A dialogue box will open asking if you would like to save before continuing. Click “YES”.
3. The Create Transmittal dialogue box will open. Click on “Transmittal Setup.”
4. Click Modify.
5. Toggle “Place all files in one folder”, “Set default plotter to none”, “Purge drawings”, and “Include fonts”. Click OK
6. The dialogue box will close. Click OK on the Create Transmittal dialogue box. A save dialogue box will open. All eTransmit files should be saved in the Correspondence folder, in a sub folder named TO and the entity you are sending the files to.
7. When the save is complete, you may attach the .zip folder to an email as you would any other file.
