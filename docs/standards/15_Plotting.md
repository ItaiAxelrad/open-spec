## Plotting and Pen Settings

Plan production is the cornerstone of a business's practice. It is important to take extra care when selecting your plot settings to ensure that the appearance of all plans and drawings is uniform.

### Plot Settings

In section I. of this chapter, the process for using Page Set-up Manager is described. If your sheet tabs were properly set up using this feature, when you need to plot a drawing all of the plot settings will already be fixed as you need them to be. In the event that you are working in a drawing that was not set up this way, you will need to adjust your plot settings as follows:

Command line: `PLOT` (or `Ctrl+P`).
The Plot dialogue box will open.

### Page Setup

This is the first pulldown at the top of the Plot dialogue box. If you use the Page Setup Manager, your sheet options will be available to you here. Select the appropriate setup, preview the drawing and if all is correct, select “OK” and your drawing will be sent to the appropriate plotter.

For older drawings not set up on the current Template:

1. Delete all page setups in the list and select “Import”
2. A dialogue box will open. Select the file N:/Autodesk/Blocks/TitleBlocks.dwg
3. A new dialogue box will appear. Select all appropriate page setups and click “OK”.
4. You will now be able to select any of the page setups you selected from the Plot dialogue box.

There may be instances when it is not desirable to use any of the default Page Setups. In that event you may select the plotter and settings manually.

### Plotter Pen Settings

All colors are assigned a Pen number based on the ending number of the color. For example: color 11 is a Pen 1, color 226 is a Pen 6, and color 48 is a Pen 8. Colors ending in 0 plot in color and are assigned a Pen 4 width. If the color is in a “screened” row, it will plot gray with the corresponding Pen width. The following chart mimics the provided XXX.ctb file (see Support Files) and shall always be used when plotting

### Printer/Plotter

Pull down the menu and select the appropriate printer/plotter for your office.

### Plot Area

1. In this pull-down there are four options: Display, Extents, Layout, Window. In most cases you will select “Window”.
2. When you select “Window” A “Window&lt;” button will appear to the right of the Plot Area list.
3. Click the “Window&lt;” button and draw a box around all items you wish to appear in the plot. For title blocks, snap to the corners of the red border for scale plotting.

### Paper size

For any paper size that is not covered in the Template page setups, you may select from the list of available paper sizes for the printer you have selected

### Plot Style Table

In the upper right hand corner of the Plot dialogue box is a pull down for the list of Plot Style Tables. For drawings not set up from the Template or with imported Page Setups, you may select the Plot Style from this list. In almost all cases you will be selecting a .ctb file from the list with company in the name. Be advised that each style changes the line weights and in some cases, colors of the lines, so choose carefully.

### Line Weights

Leave this in the default position.

### Scale

When you have selected a plot window you may choose to scale the drawing. After selecting the scale you want the drawing to print at, preview your plot before sending to make sure it is correct.

### Plot Options

Leave these toggles in the default position.

### Drawing Orientation

You may toggle landscape or portrait as needed.

### Shaded Viewport Options

Leave this in the default position.

### Plot Offset

Typically you will toggle “Center the Plot”

## Electronic Plotting

The two main file types for electronic plotting are .pdf and .dwf. Pdf files are viewed with Adobe software, Dwf files are viewed with Autodesk Design Review. In many cases, submittals to clients and reviewing agencies will be in one of these two formats. Typically pdfs are larger and require compression when transmitting. Dwfs are smaller, however not all recipients have the appropriate software to view the drawings in this format.

To plot a drawing as a pdf:

1. Follow Plot steps as above, importing and selecting the appropriate pdf page setup. When clicking ok to initiate the plot, a dialogue box will open.
2. Search for the folder you wish to save the .pdf in and click Save.

To plot a drawing as dwf:

1. Repeat steps as above, importing and selecting the appropriate pdf page setup.
