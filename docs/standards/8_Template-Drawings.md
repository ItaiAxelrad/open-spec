A Template is a seed file that incorporates all of CAD styles to create drawings that are uniform in appearance. Every drawing you create should start with the most current template. If you follow the AutoCAD setup instructions correctly, any new drawing you create will be based on the Template without any additional steps.

The Template is a continuously evolving entity based on the needs of the users. If you find something is missing or needs to be added to the Template file, please contact the CAD Manager with your suggestions. DO NOT attempt to modify the Template directly.

Older drawings can be brought more current by the use of the Import Styles command. Procedure for this command is as follows:

1. From the main AutoCAD screen, select the “Manage” tab from the ribbon.
2. Click Import. You will be prompted to save. Do so and click Import again.
3. A dialogue box will open. Search for the Template at this location: N:\Autodesk\Templates\C3D_20XX.dwt
4. Select the template and click “Open”.
5. An Import Civil 3D Styles dialogue box will open
6. Toggle “Check All”, Check “Deleted”, Check “Added”, and “Check Conflicting”.
7. Click OK and follow prompts to complete the import.

This will add all of the current styles to any drawing. This procedure is not necessary for any new drawing that you create.
