AutoDesk currently has a network based license for several seats that have to be “checked out” when using their software. Double click on the icon on your desktop to get started. For connecting remotely, do not launch AutoCAD until your VPN connection is established and you have clicked on the server in windows explorer to establish a connection to the network or some of the settings may disassociate.
