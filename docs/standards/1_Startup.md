AutoDesk currently has a network based license for several seats that have to be “checked out” when using their software. Double click on the icon on your desktop to get started. For connecting remotely, do not launch AutoCAD until your VPN connection is established and you have clicked on the server in windows explorer to establish a connection to the network or some of the settings may disassociate.

- **Current Software:** AutoCAD Civil 3D 2023

## Remote Working

First, connect to the VPN. Next, open windows explorer and click on the network drives to connect to them (the icons will change from red to green) to ensure all necessary paths can be loaded prior to launching AutoCAD.

### Best Practices

- It’s preferable to keep the files on the networks and work through the VPN, but if you must you can copy files to your desktop.
- If you do copy the file to your desktop, rename the file on the network and communicate regularly with the project team to ensure file integrity.
- Utilize Zoom to communicate with the project team and to coordinate what you are working on. You can create project channels on zoom if multiple people are working on a given project or create project channels if applicable.
- Streamline the file if possible, to avoid file latency (unload large aerials, etc.).
- Century link customers may need to apply a patch before gaining access to network drives over VPN.
- If possible, use ethernet cord rather than WiFi.
- Turn off auto-rebuild for surfaces and corridors.
- Check-out Civil 3D license if you are working offline.
- Unload images or xrefs that are not needed to make drawing work faster. Hatches will sometimes slow a drawing down.
- If you are working on a drawing that is saved to your desktop, make sure nobody else will be editing that file so when you save it back to the network you are not erasing work done by others.
- If a file is slow to open, consider opening before you are ready to start working so you are not waiting around.
