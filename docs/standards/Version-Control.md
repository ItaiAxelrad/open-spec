All active project drawings are to be kept in the Drawings folder of the file tree. In the event that significant changes happen, you should save the old file. The active drawing should be voided by performing a Save-As with the date of the change (format YEAR-MM-DY) added to the drawing title. Example: 2931a-civil-detention pond-2012-02-07.

This voided drawing should be saved in a sub-folder of the Drawings folder titled Archive. Once the Save As is complete, re-open the original drawing and proceed with changes. Significant changes include revisions to site features such as structures, roadway alignments, drainage ponds & channels, etc. A void should also be performed prior to addressing any comments to drawings from public entity review.

## Archive Function

For drawings that have Sheet Set Manager enabled, the Archive command should be used when final approval for plans is received and prior to onset of construction activities. The procedure for Archive is as follows:

1. Command line: `ARCHIVE`. This may take several minutes.
2. A dialogue box will open. Click on Modify Archive Setup
3. A new dialogue box will open. Toggle “Place all files in one folder” and “Purge Drawings”. Click OK
4. In the Enter Notes box, place the date of the final approval and click OK
5. A save dialogue box will open. Save the archive in the Drawings folder of the project, adding the date of the final approval to the title. In the event that multiple Archives occur during the course of a project, create an Archive sub-folder in the Drawings folder and save all archives there.
