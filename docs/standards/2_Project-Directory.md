Each office has their own server with unique letter designation where projects are stored. Other resources, including CAD support files, are housed in a dedicated server shared by all offices. Take the following steps upon your first use at your station with your appropriate server.

All projects are given a unique alphanumeric code or Job Number setup by the project manager. The structure of this code is based on the year and month the project was awarded, and the next job number available.

- N:\\2021\\2101001

Any new project directory should have the standard file tree installed. That file tree can be found in N:/images/standards/Project Directory.

## Calculations

This folder is for general project calculations. Folders shall be created for each type of calculation so they are easy to find and will not confuse anybody on what is what.

- Scanned copies of paper calculations
- Water/wastewater WaterCAD models
- Sanitary Sewer Service Tables
- Water and Sanitary Sewer Demands

## Construction

All post design documentation will be saved in this folder.

## Correspondence

Any project related emails or scanned hard copy communications appropriate for the permanent project record. This folder should be subdivided into “To” and “From” folders for each entity involved with the project.

- To
  - Company Name/Jurisdiction/Client
  - Create a folder with the date and description of what is in it.
  - 20YY-MM-DD Description

## Drawings

The drawing folder is where all AutoCAD files are to be saved for the project. Inside this folder are subfolders to help organize the different types of production drawings and exhibits. The main base drawings used for the project shall be saved outside of the subfolders because they are xref’d in multiple drawings. Base drawings should be easy to find and always found in the same spot in every project file.

### Construction Documents

This folder shall contain all related drawings used for the creation of the Construction Documents. This includes title blocks and common files used for creation of the CDs. The file name shall be as short/simple as possible because it auto populates in the title block.

### Details

Save PDF’s details that are x-referenced into your production drawings in this folder. Never xref PDF/Images/Details from other projects or general folders such as the Jurisdiction folder. If the file is saved over/deleted/renamed, your xref link will be broken. This is also a way to know what version of the detail you are using in your project, details are updated frequently.

### Drainage Maps

- Proposed Drainage Map
- Historic Drainage Map

### Exhibits

Create a folder with the exhibit name and save the CAD file and PDF’s into it. Placing the exhibits in a folder with a description helps when people are not familiar with the project and they are looking for a specific exhibit.

- 20YY-MM-DD Description

### Archive

This is the archive folder for the project. When archiving drawings create a new folder with the current date & description and copy the drawings/PDF’s into the folder. Use the Year/Month/Day naming convention “20YY-MM-DD” so the order of folders is sorted by date.

- 20YY-MM-DD Description
