## Execution

1. PREPARATION
   1. Preparation of Sub grade
   1. Prior to any work of this Section, the sub grade may require scarifying and recompacting to a minimum of 95% of the maximum density as determined in accordance with AASHTO T-180. No paving shall be started until the results of the compaction tests are known, the final grade has been checked, and the Contractor has been given notice to proceed by the Owner.
   1. Apply soil sterilization to sub grade at the rate of 1 gallon of solution to 100 square feet. Do not overspray onto adjacent vegetation.
   1. ERECTION INSTALLATION APPLICATION
   1. Construct concrete paving, walk, curb, and combination curb and gutter to cross-section indicated by extrusion or wood or metal forms in accordance with Section 033000 - Cast In Place Concrete.
   1. Construct transverse expansion joints at intervals of approximately 30 feet in length, except at closures. Slab shall not be less than 6 feet in length and shall be separated by transverse preformed joint filler 1/2" thick, extending from the bottom of the slab to approximately 1/4" below the top of the surface.
   1. Divide slab between expansion joints into sections approximately 5 feet in length by transverse control joints formed by a jointing tool, trowel, or other means. The control joints shall extend into the concrete for at least one-fourth of the depth and shall be approximately 1/8" wide. Where slabs are more than 7 feet in width, form control joints longitudinally to obtain uniform blocks, approximately square.
   1. Form construction joints around all appurtenances, such as manholes or utility poles extending into and through the sidewalk.
   1. Install preformed joint filler between concrete sidewalks and any fixed structure such as a building or bridge.
   1. Where sidewalk or paving is constructed in conjunction with adjacent curb, the expansion joints in the curb and sidewalk/paving shall coincide. Where such construction is adjacent to existing curb, the expansion joints shall, if practicable, coincide.
   1. In-Laid Thermo-Plastic Markings:
      1. Provide for all crosswalks and stop bars.
   1. Saw or grind grooves in pavement for application of thermo-plastic material.
   1. Prime substrate as required by manufacturer.
   1. Install in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Apply in 250 or 400 mil thickness. Apply such that cooled material is flush with or slightly above groove lip.
   1. Crosswalks:
      1. Provide 24" bars applied in "Continental" style (center of lane and center of line). Provide 8' minimum wide crosswalks.
   1. Stop Bars:
      1. Provide 24" wide bars.
   1. Glass Beads:
      1. Drop into thermo-plastic material immediately after application.
   1. Apply with mechanical equipment to produce a wet film thickness not less than 0.015" and 4" line widths unless otherwise required.
   1. Handicap Parking:
      1. International symbol for handicap parking.
