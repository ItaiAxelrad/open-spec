   1. Pipe Base and Pipe Zone Backfill:
      1. 
   1. Pipe Base:
      1. Place granular base for the full width of the trench. The top of the granular base shall be at flow line grade.

All work must conform to Town of Parker and Parker Water and Sanitation District Standards and Specifications. 
2. Pipe Zone Backfill:
      1. Backfill the pipe zone to 6 inches above the top outside of the pipe for the full width of the trench with backfill material conforming to granular pipe base, as specified herein. Place in the trench in lifts not exceeding 6 inches in uncompacted thickness on both sides of the pipe. Compact each lift to a minimum of 95 percent of maximum density as determined by AASHTO T180. Controlled low-strength material may be used in place of pipe zone backfill when approved by the Engineer. If publicly owned, work must conform to jurisdictional authority’s requirements. 
   1. Trench Backfill Above Pipe Zone:
      1. If publicly owned, work must conform to jurisdictional authority’s requirements.
2. When backfill is placed mechanically, push the backfill material onto the slope of the backfill previously placed and allow to slide down into the trench. Do not push backfill into the trench in such a way as to permit free fall of the material until at least 2 feet of properly placed and compacted cover is provided over the top of the pipe. Under no circumstances allow sharp, heavy pieces of material to drop directly onto the pipe or the tamped material around the pipe. 
3. Aggregate base backfill, above the pipe zone, shall be of approved or specified material in lifts not exceeding 8 inch loose depth. Compact each lift with mechanical vibrating or impact tampers to a minimum of 95 percent of maximum density as deter+mined by AASHTO T180 and within 2 percent of optimum moisture content.

5. Material shall be moisture conditioned and then placed so that, when compacted, it forms a homogeneous mass free from lenses, pockets, streaks and layers of material differing substantially in texture, moisture content, and gradation.
6. Backfill shall be placed in uniform horizontal layers (parallel to the finished surface) not exceeding 8 inches loose thickness when compacted with large equipment or not exceeding 6 inches loose thickness in areas compacted with hand-operated equipment, unless otherwise shown or specified.
7. Each layer of backfill shall be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by AASHTO T180 and within 2 percent of optimum moisture content.

      1. Of such unstable nature as to be incapable of being compacted to specified density using ordinary methods at optimum moisture content; or
   1. Too wet to be properly compacted, and circumstances prevent suitable in-place drying prior to incorporation into the work; or
   1. Otherwise unsuitable for the planned use.
   1. Unsuitable materials encountered in the subgrade shall be removed as directed by the Engineer. The excavated area shall be backfilled and compacted with approved material.
   1. Any removal of Unsuitable Material encountered in the subgrade and not authorized by the Engineer will be considered Unauthorized Excavation.
