      1. MATERIALS

## General

:
      1. All pipe, fittings, couplings, and appurtenant items shall be new, designed for the intended service, and free from defects or contamination. They shall be furnished in pressure or thickness classes as specified or shown. All pipe shall have joints as called for in the specifications or indicated on the Drawings.
   1. part 3:
      1. execution

## General

:
      1. In the absence of specific wording to the contrary, the Contractor shall follow normal good construction practice in accordance with materials manufacturer's printed instructions. This specification includes the installation of several different pipeline materials. Refer to other specifications, the Drawings and the Proposal for the type of pipe included in this Contract. The depth of bury is shown on the Drawings or specified in the Special Construction Provisions.
   1. HANDLING OF MATERIAL:
      1. Pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants, and all other accessories shall be loaded and unloaded by lifting with hoists or skidding so as to avoid shock or damage to them. Under no circumstances shall any materials be dropped. Pipe handled on skidways shall not be skidded or rolled against pipe already on the ground. Skidding which damages protective coatings will not be permitted.
   1. In distributing the material at the site of the work, each piece shall be unloaded opposite or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench to prevent moving more than once. 
   1. All pipe and fittings shall be so handled that the coating and lining will not be damaged. If, however, any part of the coating or lining is damaged, the repair shall be by the Contractor at his expense in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. Any area damage beyond repair must be cut off and discarded.
   1. PIPE LAYING. Pipe shall be laid with bell ends facing in the direction of laying, unless directed otherwise by the Engineer. Pipe shall be laid on the bedding with support over the full length of the pipe barrel.
   1. When pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of pipe shall be closed by a watertight plug or by other means approved by the Engineer.
   1. The cutting of pipe for inserting valves, fittings, or closure pieces shall be done in a neat and workmanlike manner without damage to the pipe or cement lining so as to leave a smooth end at right angles to the axis of the pipe. The flame cutting of pipe by means of an oxyacetylene torch will not be allowed. The pipe end shall be beveled and free of sharp edges that could damage the gasket during installation
   1. INSTALLATION OF VALVES AND BOXES:
      1. Valves shall be installed where shown on the Drawings or as directed by the Engineer in the field and shall be set with the operator plumb. Valves shall have the interior cleaned of all foreign matter before installation. Stuffing boxes shall be tightened and the valves shall be operated to opened and closed positions to insure that all parts are in working condition before installation. Installation and jointing procedures shall be similar to the attached piping installation. Special piping shall be used when required because of conflict with butterfly valve discs.
   1. Unless otherwise noted, a valve box shall be provided for every valve. The box shall not transmit shock or stress to the valve or operator and shall be centered and plumbed over the operating nut of the valve, with the box cover flush with the surface of the finished grade or such other level as may be directed by the Engineer. The adjustable valve box shall permit at least 3 inches of adjustment either direction when in place.
