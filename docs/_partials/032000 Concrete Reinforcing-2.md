1. ## Product** 
1. REINFORCEMENT BARS 
1..1 Bars:
      1. Steel reinforcements shall be new, deformed billet steel, meeting ASTM Standard A615 or A706; for rebars No. 4 and larger, Grade 60; for No. 3 rebars and designated reinforcement, Grade 40 or Grade 60. 
   1. Bend test:
      1. 
   1. Meet 180-degree bend at 60-degree Fahrenheit. minimum temperature without cracking when bent around pin diameter indicated. 
   1. Number 3, 4 and 5 bars around pin diameter equal to 4 times nominal bar diameter.
   1. Number 6 through 11 bars around pin diameter equal to 5 times nominal bar diameter. 
   1. Bend test for number 14 and 18:
      1. Meet 90-degree bend at 60-degree F. minimum temperature without cracking when bent around a pin diameter equal to 10 times nominal bar diameter. 
1..2 Tie Wire
 1. Annealed steel, Federal Specifications QQ‑W‑461, 16 gauge minimum. 
1..3 Bar Supports 
 1. Conform to "Bar Support Specifications," CRSI Manual of Standard Practice. 
 2. Where concrete surface will be exposed to fluids, view or weather, the supports or accessories shall be completely comprised of non-metallic material such as plastic or shall be completely plastic or epoxy coated. 

1..4 Splice Devices
   1. Provide Thermite (Cadweld) welding process only when called for on the Drawings. Where mechanical splice devices are called for on the drawings, provide Lenton (or equal approved by the Engineer) "Formsaver" threaded reinforcement splices to match the reinforcement size that the splice is intended to extend. Splices shall meet ACI 318-89, Chapter 12 strength criteria of developing 125% of the specified yield strength of the reinforcement bar it replaces. Install per manufacturer's recommendations.
1..5 Fabrication ‑ In accordance with CRSI Manual of Standard Practice except for the allowable tolerances specified herein in Section 1.2.2.
2. WELDED WIRE FABRIC 
2..1 Welded Wire Fabric ‑ ASTM A185 or A497.

## Execution

1.  
1. PREPARATION ‑ Remove all mud, oil, loose rust or mill scale and other foreign materials that may reduce bond. Rust or mill scale which is "tight" will be permissible without cleaning or brushing provided weights, dimensions, cross sectional area, and tensile properties meet requirements of ASTM A615. 
2. INSTALLATION 
2..1 Bar Placement ‑ Conform to CRSI‑WCRSI "Placing Reinforcing Steel." 
2..2 Bar Supports 
 1. Provide minimum number of supports as required by ACI 315.
 2. Do not use pebbles, pieces of broken stone, common or face brick, metal pipe or wood blocks to support reinforcement. 
 3. On ground, where necessary, solid concrete bricks may be used to support wire chairs that in turn support the reinforcing steel in the slabs on grade. Small squares of 1/2" plywood may be used to support grade slab chairs on the compacted subgrade.
2..3 Placement Tolerances 

 1. Clear distance to formed surface:
    1. See Section 3.2.4, Concrete Cover 1. and 2. 
 2. Spacing between bars:
    1. ‑1/4 inch 
 3. Top bars in slabs and beams:
    1. See Section 3.2.4, Concrete Cover 1. and 2. 
 4. Crosswise of members:
    1. spaced evenly within 2 inches. 
 5. Lengthwise of members:
    1. +2 inches. 
 6. Maximum bar movement to avoid interference with other reinforcing steel, conduits or embedded items:
    1. one bar diameter. 
      1. If bars are moved more than one bar diameter, or enough to exceed the above tolerances, the resulting arrangement of bars may be rejected by Engineer. 
2..4 Concrete Cover 
 1. Except as otherwise indicated on the Drawings, provide the following minimum concrete cover for reinforcement:
    1. 
      1. Concrete cast against and permanently 3"
 exposed to earth: 
      1. Concrete poured in forms but exposed to earth, weather or chlorinated water:
Bars larger than #5: 2”
   1. Bars #5 or smaller:
      1. 1-1/2”
      1. Beams:
         1. 2"
      1. Walls and slabs (not exposed as in b.) 3/4"
2. Cover for reinforcing steel shall not be less than the minimum given above (no minus tolerance), and shall not exceed the minimum by more than 1/4 inch where concrete thickness is 24 inches or less, or more than 1/2 inch where the concrete thickness is more than 24 inches unless shown otherwise on the plans. At intersections of reinforcing bars and post-tension tendons, the placement of the post-tension tendons takes precedence and the cover for the reinforcing bars may be increased beyond the limits described above.

2..5 Reinforcing Adjustment 
 1. Do not heat, bend or cut bars without Engineer's approval. 
2..6 Splices 
 1. Do not splice bars except at locations shown on the Drawings without Engineer's approval. 
 2. Minimum lap distance shall be as shown on the Drawings. If not shown, splices shall be as specified in ACI 318. 
 3. Tie splices securely to prevent displacement during placement of concrete. 
 4. In horizontal wall reinforcement, alternate splices vertically so that all splices are not in the same vertical plane. 
2..7 Welded Wire Fabric 
1. Install in longest practicable length. 
2. Lap adjoining pieces one full mesh plus 2 inches minimum. 
3. Do not make laps midway between simple supported members or directly over support members of continuous structures. 
4. Offset laps in adjacent widths to prevent continuous laps.
5. Extend fabric through contraction joints and construction joints unless otherwise indicated on the Drawings.
