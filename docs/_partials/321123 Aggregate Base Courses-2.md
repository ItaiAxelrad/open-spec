## Execution


## General

 REQUIREMENTS
   1. When the ABC or GCA is constructed in more than one layer, the previously constructed layer shall be cleaned of loose and foreign matter by sweeping with power sweepers or power brooms; except that hand brooms may be used in areas where power cleaning is not practicable. Adequate drainage shall be provided during the entire period of construction to prevent water from collecting or standing on the working area. Line and grade stakes shall be provided as necessary for control. Grade stakes shall be in lines parallel to the centerline of the area under construction and suitably spaced for string lining.
2. OPERATION OF AGGREGATE SOURCES
   1. Clearing, stripping, and excavating shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The aggregate sources shall be operated to produce the quantity and quality of materials meeting these specifications requirements in the specified time limit. Upon completion of the work, the aggregate sources on subject property shall be conditioned to drain readily and shall be left in a satisfactory condition. Aggregate sources on private lands shall be conditioned in agreement with local laws or authorities.
3. STOCKPILING MATERIAL
   1. Prior to stockpiling of material, storage sites shall be cleared and leveled by the Contractor. All materials, including approved material available from excavation and grading, shall be stockpiled in the manner and at the locations designated. Aggregates shall be stockpiled on the cleared and leveled areas designated by the Owner to prevent segregation. Materials obtained from different sources shall be stockpiled separately.
4. PREPARATION OF UNDERLYING COURSE
   1. Prior to constructing the base course(s), the underlying course or subgrade shall be cleaned of all foreign substances. At the time of construction of the base course(s), the underlying course shall contain no frozen material. The surface of the underlying course or subgrade shall meet specified compaction and surface tolerances. The underlying course shall conform to Section 31 00 00 EARTHWORK and Section 32 11 16 BASE COURSE FOR RIGID AND SUBBASE FOR FLEXIBLE PAVING. Ruts or soft yielding spots in the underlying courses, areas having inadequate compaction, and deviations of the surface from the requirements set forth herein shall be corrected by loosening and removing soft or unsatisfactory material and by adding approved material, reshaping to line and grade, and recompacting to specified density requirements. For cohesionless underlying courses containing sands or gravels, as defined in ASTM D 2487, the surface shall be stabilized prior to placement of the base course(s). Stabilization shall be accomplished by mixing ABC or GCA into the underlying course and compacting by approved methods. The stabilized material shall be considered as part of the underlying course and shall meet all requirements of the underlying course. The finished underlying course shall not be disturbed by traffic or other operations and shall be maintained by the Contractor in a satisfactory condition until the base course is placed.
5. INSTALLATION
   1. Mixing the Materials
1. The coarse and fine aggregates shall be mixed in a stationary plant, or in a traveling plant or bucket loader on an approved paved working area. The Contractor shall make adjustments in mixing procedures or in equipment as directed to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation or degradation, to obtain the required water content, and to insure a satisfactory base course meeting all requirements of this specification. Adjustments to the JMF shall be limited to plus or minus 5 percent on the 1-1/2 inch and coarser sieves; plus or minus 8 percent on the 1 inch to No. 4 sieves; plus or minus 5 percent on the No. 30 sieve, and plus or minus 3 percent on the No. 200 sieve. Tolerances given above may permit the aggregate grading to be outside the limits shown in Table 2; this shall be acceptable.
   1. Placing
1. The mixed material shall be placed on the prepared subgrade or subbase in layers of uniform thickness with an approved spreader. When a compacted layer 6 inches or less in thickness may be required, the material shall be placed in a single layer. When a compacted layer in excess of 6 inches may be required, the material shall be placed in layers of equal thickness. No layer shall be thicker than 6 inches or thinner than 3 inches when compacted. The layers shall be so placed that when compacted they shall be true to the grades or levels required with the least possible surface disturbance. Where the base course has been placed in more than one layer, the previously constructed layers shall be cleaned of loose and foreign matter by sweeping with power sweepers, power brooms, or hand brooms, as directed. Such adjustments in placing procedures or equipment shall be made as may be directed to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation and degradation, to adjust the water content, and to insure an acceptable base course.
   1. Grade Control
1. The finished and completed base course shall conform to the lines, grades, and cross sections shown. Underlying material(s) shall be excavated and prepared at sufficient depth for the required base course thickness so that the finished base course and the subsequent surface course shall meet the designated grades.
   1. Edges of Base Course
1. The base course(s) shall be placed so that the completed section shall be a minimum of 2 feet wider, on all sides, than the next layer that shall be placed above it. Additionally, approved fill material shall be placed along the outer edges of the base course in sufficient quantities to compact to the thickness of the course being constructed, or to the thickness of each layer in a multiple layer course, allowing in each operation at least a 2 foot width of this material to be rolled and compacted simultaneously with rolling and compacting of each layer of base course. If this base course material is to be placed adjacent to another pavement section, then the layers for both of these sections shall be placed and compacted along this edge at the same time.
   1. Compaction
1. Each layer of the base course shall be compacted as specified with approved compaction equipment. Water content shall be maintained during the compaction procedure to within plus or minus 2 percent of the optimum water content determined from laboratory tests as specified in paragraph SAMPLING AND TESTING. Rolling shall begin at the outside edge of the surface and proceed to the center, overlapping on successive trips at least one-half the width of the roller. Alternate trips of the roller shall be slightly different lengths. Speed of the roller
   1. shall be such that displacement of the aggregate does not occur. In all places not accessible tothe rollers, the mixture shall be compacted with hand-operated power tampers. Compaction shall continue until each layer has a degree of compaction that is at least 100 percent of laboratory maximum density through the full depth of the layer. The Contractor shall make such adjustments in compacting or finishing procedures as may be directed to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation and degradation, to reduce or increase water content, and to ensure a satisfactory base course. Any materials that are found to be unsatisfactory shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory material or reworked, as directed, to meet the requirements of this specification.
   1. Thickness
1. Compacted thickness of the base course shall be as indicated. No individual layer shall be thicker than 6 inches nor be thinner than 3 inches in compacted thickness. The total compacted thickness of the base course(s) shall be within 1/2 inch of the thickness indicated. Where the measured thickness is more than 1/2 inch deficient, such areas shall be corrected by scarifying, adding new material of proper gradation, reblading, and recompacting as directed. Where the measured thickness is more than 1/2 inch thicker than indicated, the course shall be considered as conforming to the specified thickness requirements. Average job thickness shall be the average of all thickness measurements taken for the job, but shall be within 1/4 inch of the thickness indicated. The total thickness of the base course shall be measured at intervals in such a manner as to ensure one measurement for each 500 square yards of base course. Measurements shall be made in 3 inch diameter test holes penetrating the base course.
   1. Proof Rolling
1. Proof rolling of the areas indicated shall be in addition to the compaction specified and shall consist of the application of 4-8 coverages with a heavy pneumatic-tired roller having four or more tires, each loaded to a minimum of 30,000 pounds and inflated to a minimum of 125 psi. In areas designated, proof rolling shall be applied to the top of the underlying material on which the base course is laid and to each layer of base course top of the completed ABC and GCA course. Water content of the underlying material shall be maintained at optimum or at the percentage directed from start of compaction to completion of proof rolling of that layer. Water content of each layer of the base course shall be maintained at the optimum percentage directed from start of compaction to completion of proof rolling. Any base course materials or any underlying materials that produce unsatisfactory results by proof rolling shall be removed and replaced with satisfactory materials, recompacted and proof rolled to meet these specifications.
   1. Finishing
1. The surface of the top layer of base course shall be finished after final compaction and proof rolling by cutting any overbuild to grade and rolling with a steel-wheeled roller. Thin layers of material shall not be added to the top layer of base course to meet grade. If the elevation of the top layer of base course is 1/2 inch or more below grade, then the top layer should be scarified to a depth of at least 3 inches and new material shall be blended in and compacted, compacted and proof rolled to bring to grade. Adjustments to rolling and finishing procedures shall be made as directed to minimize segregation and degradation, obtain grades, maintain moisture content, and insure an acceptable base course. Should the surface become rough, corrugated, uneven in texture, or traffic marked prior to completion, the unsatisfactory portion shall be scarified, reworked and recompacted or it shall be replaced as directed.
   1. Smoothness
1. The surface of the top layer shall show no deviations in excess of 3/8 inch when tested with a 12 foot straightedge. Measurements shall be taken in successive positions parallel to the centerline of the area to be paved. Measurements shall also be taken perpendicular to the centerline at 50 foot intervals. Deviations exceeding this amount shall be corrected by removing material and replacing with new material, or by reworking existing material and compacting it to meet these specifications.
6. TRAFFIC
   1. Traffic shall not be allowed on the completed base course. Completed portions of the base course may be opened to limited traffic, provided there is no marring or distorting of the surface by the traffic. Heavy equipment shall not be permitted except when necessary to construction, and then the area shall be protected against marring or damage to the completed work.
7. MAINTENANCE
   1. The base course shall be maintained in a satisfactory condition until the full pavement section has been completed and accepted. Maintenance shall include immediate repairs to any defects and shall be repeated as often as necessary to keep the area intact. Any base course that has not been paved over prior to the onset of winter shall be retested to verify that it still complies with the requirements of this specification. Any area of base course that has been damaged shall be reworked or replaced as necessary to comply with this specification.
8. DISPOSAL OF UNSATISFACTORY MATERIALS
   1. Any unsuitable materials that must be removed shall be disposed of outside the limits of
the project area or as directed in waste disposal areas indicated. No additional payments shall be made for materials that must be replaced.
