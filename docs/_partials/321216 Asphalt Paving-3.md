3. Pay Factor Based on In-place Density
      1. An example of the computation of a pay factor (in I-P units only) based on in-place density, is as follows:
         1. Assume the following test results for field density made on the lot:
         1. (1) Average mat density = 93.2 percent of TMD. 
(2) Average joint density = 91.5 percent of TMD. (3) Total area of lot = 30,000 square feet. (4) Length of completed longitudinal construction joint = 2000 feet.

(i) Step 1: Determine pay factor based on mat density and on joint density, using Table 8:
      1. (a) Mat density of 93.2 percent = 98.3 pay factor.

(b) Joint density of 91.5 percent = 97.3 pay factor.

(ii) Step 2: Determine ratio of joint area (length of longitudinal joint x 5 ft) to mat area (total paved area in the lot): Multiply the length of completed longitudinal construction joint by the specified 5 ft. width and divide by the mat area (total paved area in the lot).

(a) (2000 ft. x 5 ft.)/30000 sq.ft. = 0.3333 ratio of joint area to mat area (ratio).

(iii) Step 3: Weighted pay factor (wpf) for joint is determined as indicated below:
      1. (a) wpf = joint pay factor + (100 - joint pay factor) (1 - ratio)

(b) wpf = 97.3 + (100-97.3) (1-.3333) = 99.1%

(iv) Step 4: Compare weighted pay factor for joint density to pay factor for mat density and select the smaller:
      1. (a) Pay factor for mat density:
         1. 98.3%. Weighted pay factor for joint density:
         1. 99.1%

(b) Select the smaller of the two values as pay factor based on density: 98.3%
   1. Grade
1. The final wearing surface of pavement shall conform to the elevations and cross sections shown and shall vary not more than 0.05 foot from the plan grade established and approved at site of work. Finished surfaces at juncture with other pavements shall coincide with finished surfaces of abutting pavements. Deviation from the plan elevation shall not be permitted in areas of pavements where closer conformance with planned elevation is required for the proper functioning of drainage and other appurtenant structures involved. The grade shall be determined by running lines of levels at intervals of 25 feet, or less, longitudinally and transversely, to determine the elevation of the completed pavement surface. Within 5 working days, after the completion of a particular lot incorporating the final wearing surface, the Contractor shall test the final wearing surface of the pavement for conformance with the specified plan grade. When more than 5 percent of all measurements made within a lot are outside the 0.05 foot tolerance, the pay factor based on grade for that lot shall be 95 percent. In areas where the grade exceeds the tolerance by more than 50 percent, the Contractor shall remove the surface lift full depth; the Contractor shall then replace the lift with hot-mix asphalt to meet specification requirements, at no additional cost to the Owner. Diamond grinding may be used to remove high spots to meet grade requirements. Skin patching for correcting low areas or planing or milling for correcting high areas shall not be permitted.
   1. Surface Smoothness
1. The Contractor shall use one of the following methods to test and evaluate surface smoothness of the pavement. All testing shall be performed in the presence of the Owner. Detailed notes of the results of the testing shall be kept and a copy furnished to the Owner immediately after each day's testing. The profilograph method shall be used for all longitudinal testing, except where the runs would be less than 200 feet in length and the ends where the straightedge shall be used. Where drawings show required deviations from a plane surface (crowns, drainage inlets, etc.), the surface shall be finished to meet the approval of the Owner.
2. Smoothness Requirements
      1. Straightedge Testing:
         1. The finished surfaces of the pavements shall have no abrupt change of 1/4 inch or more, and all pavements shall be within the tolerances of 1/4 inch in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, when tested with an approved 12 feet straightedge.
      1. Profilograph Testing:
         1. The finished surfaces of the pavements shall have no abrupt change of 1/8 inch or more, and each 0.1 mile segment of each pavement lot shall have a Profile Index not greater than 9 inches/mile when tested with an approved California-type profilograph. If the extent of the pavement in either direction is less than 200 feet, that direction shall be tested by the straightedge method and shall meet requirements specified above.
3. Testing Method
      1. After the final rolling, but not later than 24 hours after placement, the surface of the pavement in each entire lot shall be tested by the Contractor in such a manner as to reveal all surface irregularities exceeding the tolerances specified above. Separate testing of individual sublots is not required. If any pavement areas are ground, these areas shall be retested immediately after grinding. Each lot of the pavement shall be tested in both a longitudinal and a transverse direction on parallel lines. The transverse lines shall be 15 feet or less apart, as directed. The longitudinal lines shall be at the centerline of each paving lane for lanes less than 20 feet wide and at the third points for lanes 20 feet or wider. Other areas having obvious deviations shall also be tested. Longitudinal testing lines shall be continuous across all joints.
(i) Straightedge Testing. The straightedge shall be held in contact with the surface and moved ahead one-half the length of the straightedge for each successive measurement. The amount of surface irregularity shall be determined by placing the freestanding (unleveled) straightedge on the pavement surface and allowing it to rest upon the two highest spots covered by its length, and measuring the maximum gap between the straightedge and the pavement surface in the area between these two high points.

(ii) Profilograph Testing. Profilograph testing shall be performed using approved equipment and procedures described in CDT Test 526. The equipment shall utilize electronic recording and automatic computerized reduction of data to indicate "must-grind" bumps and the Profile Index for each 0.1 mile segment of each pavement lot. Grade breaks on parking lots shall be accommodated by breaking the profile segment into shorter sections and repositioning the blanking band on each segment. The "blanking band" shall be 0.2 inches wide and the "bump template" shall span 1 inch with an offset of 0.3 inch. The Profile Index shall be computed for each pass of the profilograph in each 0.1 mile segment. The Profile Index for each segment shall be the average of the Profile Indices for each pass in each segment. The profilograph shall be operated by a DOT approved operator. A copy of the reduced tapes shall be furnished the Owner at the end of each day's testing.
4. Payment Adjustment for Smoothness
      1. Straightedge Testing. Location and deviation from straightedge for all measurements shall be recorded. When between 5.0 and 10.0 percent of all measurements made within a lot exceed the tolerance specified in paragraph Smoothness Requirements above, after any reduction of high spots or removal and replacement, the computed pay factor for that lot based on surface smoothness, shall be 95 percent. When more than 10.0 percent of all measurements exceed the tolerance, the computed pay factor shall be 90 percent. When between 15.0 and 20.0 percent of all measurements exceed the tolerance, the computed pay factor shall be 75 percent. When 20.0 percent or more of the measurements exceed the tolerance, the lot shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Owner. Regardless of the above, any small individual area with surface deviation which exceeds the tolerance given above by more than 50 percent, shall be corrected by diamond grinding to meet the specification requirements above or shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Owner.
      1. Profilograph Testing. Location and data from all profilograph measurements shall be recorded. When the Profile Index of a 0.1 mile segment of a lot exceeds the tolerance specified in paragraph Smoothness Requirements above by 1.0 inch/mile, but less than 2.0 inches/mile, after any reduction of high spots or removal and replacement, the computed pay factor for that lot based on surface smoothness shall be 95 percent. When the Profile Index exceeds the tolerance by 2.0 inches/mile, but less than 3.0 inches/mile, the computed pay factor shall be 90 percent. When the Profile Index exceeds the tolerance by 3.0 inches/mile, but less than 4.0 inches/mile, the computed pay factor shall be 75 percent. When the Profile Index exceeds the tolerance by 4.0 inches/mile or more, the lot shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Owner. Regardless of the above, any small individual area with surface deviation which exceeds the tolerance given above by more than 5.0 inches/mile or more, shall be corrected by grinding to meet the specification requirements above or shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Owner.
      1. Bumps ("Must Grind" Areas). Any bumps ("must grind" areas) shown on the profilograph trace which exceed 0.3 inch in height shall be reduced by diamond grinding until they do not exceed 0.3 inch when retested. Such grinding shall be tapered in all directions to provide smooth transitions to areas not requiring grinding. The following shall not be permitted:
         1. (1) skin patching for correcting low areas, (2) planing or milling for correcting high areas. At the Contractor's option, pavement areas, including ground areas, may be rechecked with the profilograph in order to record a lower Profile Index.
