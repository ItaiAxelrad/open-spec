   1. Slump
   1. Air Content (%)
   1. 4,000 psi
   1. 2-4”
   1. 5-8%
   1. EXECUTION
   1. CONCRETE MIXING AND DELIVERY:
      1. Concrete used for walks shall contain at least 6.0 sacks of cement per cubic yard and 5-8% entrained air.
   1. Deliver concrete to the job and discharge entire contents within 1 1/2 hours, or before drum has turned 300 revolutions, whichever occurs first, after introduction of mixing water. In hot weather, or under conditions contributing to quick set of concrete, shorter times may be required by the Owner's representative.
   1. Add no water at the job site.
   1. Concrete shall not be placed when temperatures are below 50º F.
   1. CONCRETE PLACEMENT:
      1. Convey, place and consolidate concrete in compliance with the practices and recommendations of ACI 304, and as herein specified. Provide expansion joints using expansion joint material located as indicated and approved with a maximum of 100 ft. on center. Provide handtooled divider joints a minimum of 1 3/4” deep as indicated for exterior work. If not shown, space joints equal to the width of the walk.
   1. Notify the Owner's representative not less than 8 working hours in advance of any pour and as soon as formwork and reinforcing are substantially complete.
   1. Deposit concrete continuously or in layers of such thickness that no concrete will be placed on concrete which has hardened sufficiently to cause the formation of seams or planes of weakness within the section. If a section cannot be placed continuously, provide construction joints as herein specified. Perform concrete placing at such a rate that concrete which is being integrated with fresh concrete is still plastic. Deposit concrete as nearly as practicable to its final location to avoid segregation due to re-handling or flowing.
   1. Do not subject concrete to any procedure which will cause segregation.
   1. Screed concrete which is to receive other construction to the proper level to avoid excessive skimming or grouting.
   1. Do not use concrete which becomes non plastic and unworkable, or does not meet the required quality control limits, or which has been contaminated by foreign materials. Do not use re-tempered concrete.
   1. Remove rejected concrete from the project site and dispose of it in an acceptable location.
   1. Isolate flatwork from walls, columns, bollards, and all other vertical elements with expansion joints unless otherwise indicated.
   1. Consolidation Consolidate concrete placed in forms by mechanical vibrating equipment supplemented by hand spading, rodding or tamping. Use equipment and procedures for consolidation of concrete in accordance with the recommended practices of ACI 309, to suit the type of concrete and project conditions. Vibration of forms and reinforcing will not be permitted, unless otherwise accepted by the Owner's representative.
   1. Bring slab surfaces to the correct level with a straight edge and strike off. Use bull floats or darbies to smooth the surfaces prior to beginning finishing operations.
   1. Maintain reinforcing steel in the proper position continuously during concrete placement operations.
   1. Bonding Roughen surfaces of set concrete at all joints, except where bonding is obtained by use of a concrete bonding agent, and clean surfaces of latence, coatings, loose particles, and foreign matter. Roughen surfaces in a manner to expose bonded aggregate uniformly and to not leave latence, loose particles or aggregate or damaged concrete at the surface.
   1. Hot Weather Placement When hot weather conditions exist that would seriously impair the quality and strength of concrete, place concrete in compliance with ACI 305.
   1. FINISHING:
      1. Non slip Medium Broom Finish Apply non slip broom finish to exterior concrete flatwork platforms, steps and ramps, and elsewhere as shown on the drawings and details. Use 2" tooled edges on all concrete flatwork edges. 
   1. Immediately after trowel finishing, slightly roughen the concrete surface by brooming in the direction perpendicular to the main traffic route. Use fiber bristle broom unless otherwise directed. Coordinate the required final finish with the Owner's representative before application.
   1. Finish walls according to drawings.
   1. CONCRETE CURING AND PROTECTION:

General
 Protect freshly placed concrete from premature drying and excessive cold and hot temperature, and maintain without drying at a relatively constant temperature for the period of time necessary for hydration of the cement and proper hardening of the concrete.
   1. Start initial curing as soon as free moisture has disappeared from the concrete surface after placing and finishing. Weather permitting; keep continuously moist for not less than 72 hours.
   1. Begin final curing procedures immediately following initial curing and before the concrete has dried. Continue final curing for at least 7 days and in accordance with ACI 301 procedures. Avoid rapid drying at the end of the final curing period.
   1. Curing Methods Provide white pigmented liquid membrane curing as follows:
      1. Apply the specified membrane forming curing compound to damp concrete surfaces as soon as the water film has disappeared. Apply uniformly by spray equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. Maintain the continuity of the coating and repair damage to the coat during the entire curing period.
   1. TESTING:
      1. Concrete materials and operations will be tested and inspected as work progresses. Failure to detect any defective work or material shall not in any way prevent later rejection when such defect is discovered nor shall it obligate the Owner's representative for final acceptance.
   1. Tolerances Slabs and finished surfaces shall be in a plane, pitched and sloped as shown on the drawings within a finish tolerance 1/4" in 10' for concrete. Pockets on slabs and finished surfaces which hold water after construction will be cause for rejection of the slab.
   1. Layout Lines and Levels Before paving or forming operations commence, the site shall be substantially staked out for the work of this section for the Owner's representative’s approval.
   1. EVALUATION OF CONCRETE STRENGTH:
      1. Strengths of concrete shall be considered satisfactory if the average of any three consecutive strength tests of the laboratory cured specimens representing each specified strength of concrete is equal to or greater than the specified strength, or if test cylinders taken are equal to or greater than the specified strength.
   1. Concrete Compressive Strength If the concrete fails to meet the compressive strength requirements, additional curing may be required and modifications may be required in the concrete mix design for the remaining concrete work. Replace concrete already in place that fails to meet strength requirements.
