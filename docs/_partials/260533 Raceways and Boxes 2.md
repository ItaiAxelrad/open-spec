      1. Top of conduit shall not be less than 24 inches below finished grade and shall have a minimum slope of 3 inches per 100' away from buildings.
      1. As each conduit run is completed, a testing mandrel not less than 12 inches long with a diameter 1/4 inch less than the inside diameter of the conduit, shall be drawn through the conduit followed by a brush having stiff bristles, until the conduit is clear of all particles of earth, sand, or gravel. Conduit plugs shall then be immediately installed.
      1. There shall be not less than 3-inch clearance from the conduit to each side of the
trench.
3. Underground Conduits With Concrete Encasement:
      1. Service entrance conduits, low voltage cables, conduits extending below slab on grade, below paved areas, roadways, and parking areas shall be concrete encased.
      1. Concrete encasement shall extend at least 5' beyond the edges of paved areas and roads. Conduits to be installed under existing paved areas which are not to be disturbed shall be rigid metal conduit and shall be jacked into place. Hydraulic jet method shall not be used.
      1. Encased conduits shall be installed on suitable spacers to allow a minimum of 3 inches of encasement on all sides and a minimum of 2 inches between parallel runs.
      1. Concrete shall be Class B, 2500 psi, maximum aggregate size of 3/4 inch, slump test of 3 inches to 4 inches. Concrete shall be red where installed over conduits containing medium voltage cables.
      1. Provide OZ/Gedney Type "CSBI" conduit sealing bushings where service lateral conduits enter service equipment.
      1. Underground conduits shall be observed by the Owner's Representative and accepted by the Project Manager before backfill or encasement. The Contractor
shall notify the Project Manager a minimum of 24 hours before an observation is required.
      1. Install ductline marking tape 12 inches below finished grade over all underground power and communications service conduits.
      1. The minimum bend radius for underground service and feeder conduit shall be 36 inches except at vertical risers to equipment.
   1. Installation of Underground Handholes and Boxes:
      1. Install handholes and boxes level and plumb and with orientation and depth coordinated with connecting conduits to minimize bends and deflections required for proper entrances.
      1. Unless otherwise indicated, support units on a level bed of crushed stone or gravel, graded from 1/2-inch (12.5-mm) sieve to No. 4 (4.75-mm) sieve and compacted to same density as adjacent undisturbed earth.
      1. Elevation:
         1. In paved areas, set so cover surface will be flush with finished grade.
Set covers of other enclosures 1 inch (25 mm) above finished grade.
      1. Install removable hardware, including pulling eyes, cable stanchions, cable arms, and insulators, as required for installation and support of cables and conductors and as indicated. Select arm lengths to be long enough to provide spare space for
future cables but short enough to preserve adequate working clearances in enclosure.
      1. Field-cut openings for conduits according to enclosure manufacturer's written instructions. Cut wall of enclosure with a tool designed for material to be cut. Size holes for terminating fittings to be used, and seal around penetrations after fittings are installed.
03. PROTECTION
   1. Provide final protection and maintain conditions that ensure coatings, finishes, and cabinets are without damage or deterioration at time of Substantial Completion.
1. Repair damage to galvanized finishes with zinc-rich paint recommended by manufacturer.
2. Repair damage to PVC or paint finishes with matching touchup coating recommended by manufacturer.
