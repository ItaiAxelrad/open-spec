## Execution

1. 3.01 Storage of Materials and Reinforcing Steel:
    1. Cement and aggregates and reinforcing steel shall be stored at the work in such a manner as to prevent deterioration or intrusion of foreign matter. Any material which has deteri­orated or which has been damaged shall not be used for concrete.
1. 3.02 Batch Proportions:
    1. The Contractor shall submit his proposed mix designs to the Engineer for approval prior to undertaking any concrete work. The minimum permissible 28-day compressive strengths for the various classes of concrete shall be stated in Paragraph 2, but **the mix shall be designed for strengths at least 15 percent in excess of this minimum.
1. 3.03 Batching:
    1. All dry materials for use in Portland Cement Concrete shall be proportioned by weight, with the exception of the air entraining agent which may be proportioned by volume. The cement shall be weighed in an individual hopper and shall be kept separate from aggregates until the batch ingredients are released for discharge. The cement hopper may be at­tached to the aggregate scale for cumulative weighing, however, if this is done the cement shall be weighed before the other ingredients. Scales may be of a springless dial type or the multiple beam type. If of the multiple beam type, scales shall be provided with an indicator operated by the main beam which will give positive visible evidence of over or under weight. Prior to the use of the batch plant for batching for this contract, the Contractor shall, if requested, supply a certified statement by an independent testing firm or the appropriate agency of the State that the accuracy of the weighing is within 2 percent for aggregates, 1 percent for 
    1. cement and water. At any time during the contract, the Engineer may demand a re-certification if circumstances warrant and such certification, or re-certification shall be furnished without cost.
1. 3.04 Mixing:
    1. The concrete a furnished can be mixed at the site of the project or can be transported in a transit mix concrete truck.

 **A. On-Site Mixing** - If the concrete is mixed at the site, a suitable size mixer shall be furnished which will provide completely mixed concrete meeting the requirements of this specification. Mixers shall be operated at speeds recom­mended by the manufacturers. Automatic timing device shall be furnished and interlocked with the discharge mechanism in such a manner that no part of the batch can be discharged until specified mixing time has elapsed. In the mixers having a capacity of 1 cubic yard or less, mixing time shall not be less than 90 seconds after all material except the water are in the mixer and before any part of the batch is released. For mixers having a capacity in excess of 1 cubic yard the additional mixing time shall be 15 seconds for each cubic yard or a fraction thereof of additional capacity. The total elapsed time between the injection of the aggre­gates and the cement into the mixer and before discharge shall not exceed 30 minutes.

 **B. Transit Mix Concrete** - Each truck mixer shall have attached hereto in a prominent place a metal plate or plates on which are shown, clearly marked, the use for which the equipment is designed, the manufacturer's guaranteed capaci­ty of the drum or container in terms of volumes of mixed concrete and the speed of the rotation of the mixing drum or blades. The mixer shall be equipped with electrically actuated counters by which the number of revolutions of the drum or blades may readily be verified. The counter shall be of a resetable, recording type and shall be mounted on the driver's cab. The truck mixer when loaded to the manu­facturer's guaranteed capacity shall be capable of combining the ingredients of the concrete into a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass and of discharging the concrete with a satis­factory degree of uniformity. Each batch of concrete shall be mixed for not less than 70 nor more than 100 revolutions of the drum or blades at the rate of rotation designed by the manufacturer of the mixer as mixing speed.
    1. Additional mixing shall be at the speed designated by the manufacturer of the equipment as agitating speed. All materials including mixing water shall be in the mixer drum before actuating the revolution counter for determination of the number of revolutions of the mixer. Concrete shall be delivered to the site of the work and discharge shall be 
    1. completed while the concrete is still plastic and before it reaches initial set and in no case later than one and one-half (12) hours after addition of the cement to aggregates or before the drum has been revolved 300 revolutions, which­ever comes first. The concrete discharged from the truck mixers shall be of the consistency and workability required for the job without the use of additional mixing water. The rate of discharge of the plastic concrete from the mixer drum shall be controlled by the speed of rotation of the drum in the discharge direction, with the discharge gate fully open. Each batch of ready-mix concrete delivered at the job site shall be accompanied by a ticket showing the volume of concrete, the weight of cement in pounds and a total weight of all ingredients in pounds. The ticket shall also show the time of day in which the materials were batched into the truck.
1. 3.05 Testing:
    1. When so directed, the Contractor shall at his own expense, provide compression test samples and submit certified test reports of compressive strength from an approved testing laboratory. Compression test samples shall be made and cured in accordance with ASTM Designation C-31 "Standard Method of Making and Curing Concrete Compression and Flexur­al Test Specimens in the Field." Test samples shall be cured under conditions identical to the portion of the structure they represent insofar as possible. Specimens shall be tested in accordance with ASTM Designation C-39, "Standard Method of Test for Compressive Strength of Molded Concrete Cylinders." The Engineer may make such other tests of concrete delivered to the forms as he deems necessary to determine whether concrete meets the specification require­ments. The Contractor shall cooperate fully with the in­spector and shall provide labor for assistance if requested. The Contractor shall, when requested, furnish the following testing equipment for use by the Engineer:
    1. 1 - rubber-tired wheelbarrow
    1. 1 - D-handle round nose shovel
    1. 1 - Slump cone with pan, tamping rod, wire brush and steel trowel
    1. As Required - Cylinder molds acceptable to the Engineer
1. 3.06 Forms:
    1. The design, engineering and construction of formwork shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Work shall conform to American Concrete Institute ACI 301, "Specifications for Structural Concrete for Buildings", and ACI 347, "Recommend­ed Practice for Concrete Formwork", unless otherwise speci­fied.
    1. Forms shall conform to the shape, lines and dimensions of the members as called for on the plans, and shall be sub­stantial and sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mor­tar. They 
    1. shall be properly braced or tied together so as to maintain position and shape. The material to be used and the design of the forms shall be subject to approval by the Engineer before construction of forms is started; however, such approval will not relieve the contractor of responsibility for the adequacy of the forms nor from the necessity for remedying any defects which may develop or become apparent with use. The Engineer may at any time condemn any sections of forms found deficient in any respect and the Contractor shall promptly remove the condemned forms from the work and replace them at his own expense. Drawings showing the general design and dimensions for forms for structures need not be submitted to the Engineer for approval unless the Engineer so requests such submittal.
    1. Before concrete is placed, the surfaces of the forms shall be oiled with a commercial form oil that will effectively prevent sticking of the concrete to the forms and will not stain the concrete. All bond breaking materials or process­es shall be used only after approval by the Engineer. Care shall be taken in applying form oil to avoid contact with reinforcement steel and resulting loss of bond. Any steel which becomes coated with form oil shall be thoroughly cleaned or replaced at the expense of the Contractor.
    1. Set all required dowels, steel frames, angles, grilles, bolts, inserts, and other such items required to be anchored in the concrete before the concrete is placed.
    1. Chamfer all exposed corners of beam and wall forms with wood strips 3/4 inch by 3/4 inch. Extend terminal edges to required limit and miter chamfer strips at changes in direc­tion.
    1. Forms shall be removed in such a manner as to insure the complete safety of the structure. Where the structure as a whole is supported on shores, the removable floor forms, beams and girder sides, column and similar vertical forms may be removed after 24 hours, providing the concrete is sufficiently hard not to be injured thereby. Formwork supporting weight of concrete, such as beam soffits, joists, slabs and other structural elements may not be removed until concrete has attained design minimum 28-day compressive strength.
1. 3.07 Reinforcing:
    1. **A. General** - Fabrication and installation of reinforcing steel shall conform to ACI 315.

 **B.** **Cutting and Bending** - Reinforcement bars shall be cut and bent at the mill or shop before shipment to the work. Bending in the field will not be permitted, except to cor­rect errors or bends caused by handling, and then only when specifically authorized in writing by the Engineer. All bending shall be done cold.
    1. All reinforcement bars furnished shall be listed with com­plete plans and shall be delivered on the job in bundles securely tied. Both straight and bent bars shall be marked clearly with metal tags giving the quantity, size, length and designation of the structure in which they are to be placed.

 **C. Placing Reinforcement** - Metal reinforcement shall be accurately placed in accordance with the plans and shall be adequately secured in position by concrete or metal chairs and spacers.
    1. All bars shall be free from loose rust, scale, grease or oil when placed in the forms. Any bars not meeting this provi­sion shall be thoroughly cleaned to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
1. 3.08 Splices and Offsets in Reinforcement
    1. In slabs, beams and girders, splices of reinforcement at points of maximum stress shall generally be avoided. Splic­es shall provide sufficient lap to transfer the stress between bars by bond and shear, in accordance with the requirements of the American Concrete Institute Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete.
    1. Where changes in the cross section of a column occur, the longitudinal bars shall be offset in a region where lateral support is afforded. Where offset, the slope of the in­clined portion shall not be more than 1 in 6, and in the case of tied columns the ties shall be spaced not more than 3 inches on centers for a distance of 1 foot below the actual point of offset.

 **Concrete Protection for Reinforcement:
    1. **1.** The metal reinforcement shall be protected by the 
    1. thickness of concrete indicated in the plans. Where not otherwise shown the thickness of concrete over the rein­forcement shall be as follows:
    1. **a.** Where concrete is deposited against ground without the use of forms, not less than 3 inches.

 **b.** Where concrete is exposed to the weather or exposed to the ground but placed in forms, not less than 2 inches for bars more than 5/8 inches in diameter and 12 inches for bars 5/8 inches or less in diameter.

 **c.** In slabs and walls not exposed to the ground or to the weather, not less than 3/4 inches.

 **d.** In beams, girders and columns not exposed to the ground or to the weather, not less than 12 inches.

 **e.** In all cases the thickness of concrete over the reinforcement shall be at least equal to the diameter of the bars.

 **2.** Exposed reinforcement bars intended for bonding with
    1. future extensions shall be protected from corrosion.
1. 3.09 Placement of Concrete:
    1. **1.** No concrete shall be placed until all formwork, rein­forcement, installation of parts to be embedded, bracing of forms, and preparation of surfaces involved in the placing have been approved by the Engineer. No concrete shall be placed in water, except with the written permission of the Engineer, and the method of depositing the concrete shall be subject to his approval. All surfaces of forms and embedded materials that have become encrusted with dried mortar or grout from concreted previously placed shall be cleaned of all such mortar or grout before the surrounding or adjacent concrete is placed. Immediately before placing concrete, all surfaces upon or against which the concrete is to be placed shall be free from standing water, mud, debris or loose material. The surfaces of absorptive materials against which the concrete is to be placed shall be free from standing water, mud, debris or loose material. The surfaces of absorptive materials against or upon which concrete is to be placed shall be moistened thoroughly so that moisture will not be drawn from the freshly placed concrete.

 **2.** The concrete shall be placed by equipment which will prevent segregation or loss of ingredients. There shall be no vertical drop greater than 5 feet unless suitable equip­ment is provided to prevent segregation. Any belt conveyor, chute, tremie, or other similar equipment which may be used in the placement of concrete will be subject to approval of the Engineer. Concrete shall not be transported in the form by use of the vibrator. Placement of the concrete shall be regulated so that concrete may be and shall be deposited in lifts approximately 20 inches in thickness. The placement shall be carried on at such a rate that the formation of cold joints will be prevented. The temperature of the concrete as placed in the form shall not exceed 90E Fahren­heit, nor shall the temperature be less than 50E Fahrenheit. Higher minimum placement temperatures may be required in accordance with ACI 306. Concrete shall be compacted with mechanical vibrating equipment as required. The vibrating equipment shall be of the internal type and shall at all times be adequate in number of units and power of each unit to properly consolidate all concrete.
1. 3.10 Joints:
    1. **A. Construction Joints** - The location of all construction joints will be subject to the approval of the Engineer. The surface of all construction joints shall be cleaned of all laitance, loose or defective concrete, coatings, or foreign material by wire brushing or sand blasting followed by thoroughly washing with high pressure air-water jets immedi­ately prior to placement of fresh concrete. In addition, joints shall be thoroughly wetted and slushed with a coat of neat cement grout immediately before the placing of new concrete.

 **B. Control Joints** - Provide control joints at maximum of 15 feet each way, unless otherwise noted, in interior slabs on grade.
1. 3.11 Repair of Surface Defects:
    1. **Patching** - After forms are removed, remove all flaws or damaged area resulting from improper or poor concreting operations, rebuild or patch when approved by the Engineer. For patched areas, conform to the following:
    1. **A. Preparation of Surface:** Immediately after stripping formwork, remove defective and honeycombed areas to sound concrete with edges regular and perpendicular to surface. Wet thoroughly these areas and all tie-holes and then paint with a cement-water paste, followed immediately by the patching mortar.

 **B. Patching Mortar:** Prepare mortar of same material and proportions as sued for concrete except remove coarse aggre­gate and use Type I cement. If gray concrete is to be exposed and unpainted, substitute part of gray cement so that patching mortar, when dry, will match surrounding concrete (approximately one part white cement to one part gray cement). Keep water to a minimum.

 **C. Patching Operation:** Mix patching materials occasional­ly for an hour prior to using. Compact firmly into place by tamping and strike off slightly high. After about two hours, strike off level with a sponge rubber float and cure.
1. 3.12 Finishing

 **A. Finish of Formed Surfaces:
    1. **1. Rough Form Finish** - This includes formed concrete surfaces not exposed to view in the finish work or covered by other construction, unless otherwise shown or specified. Standard rough form finish shall be the concrete surface having the texture imparted by the form facing material used, with tie holes and defective areas repaired and patched and all fins and other projections exceeding 3 inch in height rubbed down or chipped off.

 **2. Smooth Form Finish** - This includes formed concrete surfaces exposed to view or to be covered with a coat­ing material applied directly to the concrete, or a covering material bonded to the concrete, such as waterproofing, damp-proofing, painting or other similar system. Produce smooth form finish by selecting form materials to impart a smooth, hard, uniform texture and arranging them 
    1. orderly and symmetrically with a minimum of seams. Repair and patch defective areas with all fins or other projections completely removed and smoothed.

 **3. Smooth Rubbed Finish** - Provide smooth rubbed finish, when specified, for all exposed concrete sur­faces which have received smooth form finish treatment not later than the day after form removal. Moisten concrete surfaces and rub with carborundum brick or other abrasive until a uniform color and texture is produced. Do not apply cement grout other than that created by the rubbing process.

 **4. Related Unformed Surfaces** - At tops of walls, horizontal offsets, and similar unformed surfaces occurring adjacent to formed surfaces, strike off smooth and finish with a texture matching the adjacent formed surfaces. Continue the final surface treatment of formed surfaces uniformly across the adjacent un­formed surfaces, unless other shown.

 **B. Monolithic Slab Finishes:
    1. **1. Floated Finish** - After the concrete has been placed, consolidated, struck off, and leveled, the concrete shall not be worked further until ready for floating. Floating shall begin when the water sheen has disappeared and when the surface has stiffened sufficiently to permit the operation. During or after the first floating, planeness of surface shall be checked with a 10-foot straightedge applied at not less than two different angles. All high spots shall be cut down and all low spots filled during this procedure to produce a surface plane within tolerance no exceeding 3 inch in 10 feet throughout. The slab shall then be refloated immediately to a uniform sandy texture.

 **2. Troweled Finish** - Apply trowel finish to monolith­ic slab surfaces that are to be exposed to view unless otherwise shown in schedule. The surface shall first be float finished. It shall next be power-troweled, and finally hand-troweled. The first troweling after power-floating shall produce a smooth surface which is relatively free of defects but which may still show some trowel marks. Additional trowelings shall be done by hand after the surface has hardened sufficiently. The final troweling shall be done when a ringing sound is produced as the trowel is moved over the surface. The surface shall be thoroughly consolidated by the hand-troweling operations. The finished surface shall be essentially free of trowel marks, uniform in texture and appearance and shall be planed to a tolerance not exceeding 1/8 inch in 10 feet. On surfaces intended to support floor coverings, any defects of sufficient magnitude to show through the floor covering shall be removed by grinding.
1. 3.13 Curing and Protection

 **A.** Curing shall be in accordance with ACI 308 and as follows. All structural concrete shall be cured for a period of no less than 5 consecutive days starting immedi­ately after placement by an approved method or a combination of methods. The curing medium shall be applied so as to prevent loss of moisture from the concrete for the duration of the entire curing period. Unhardened concrete shall be protected from heavy rains and flowing water. Curing may be accomplished by any of the following methods:
    1. **1. Water Curing** - Wood forms shall be kept continu­ously wet while in place. Immediately upon removal of forms, all concrete surfaces shall be kept wet by suitable sprays, covering and/or other methods of keeping water on the surface. Water curing shall not be begun for concrete flat-work until finishing work is completed.

 **2. Membrane Curing** - At the option of the contractor, the concrete may be cured with an approved surface membrane formed from a curing compound manufactured for that purpose. The compound shall be white pigmented and shall conform to the specifications for liquid membrane forming compounds for curing concrete ASTM C309. The compound shall be applied to formed surfaces immediately after the forms are removed and prior to any patching or other surface treatment, except the cleaning of loose sand, mortar, and debris from the surface. The surfaces shall be thoroughly moistened with water and the curing compound applied as soon as free water disappears. On unformed surfaces, the membrane shall be applied as soon as the wet sheet disappears. A two-coat application shall be used with approved power spraying equipment and at the coverage of not more than 200 square feet per gallon for each coat. The second coat shall be applied at approximate­ly right angles to the direction of the first applica­tion. Coated surfaces which are subject to heavy rainfall within three hours after the curing compound has been applied shall be resprayed by the methods and at the coverage herein specified. Coating shall be protected from pedestrian and vehicular traffic and any other causes which will disrupt the continuity of the curing membrane.

 **3. Form Method** - Concrete shall be protected by forms for at least 5 days. Forms shall be kept moist, when necessary, during the curing period to insure that the concrete surface remains wet.

 **4. Blanket Method** - Electrically heated curing blan­kets or insulation blankets may be used in cold weather to maintain specified curing temperature and to retain moisture in concrete. Blankets shall be lapped (8 in. minimum) and shall be free of holes. Blankets shall be secured at laps and edges to prevent moisture from escaping.
1. 3.14 Cold Weather Protection

 **A. General:** Concrete placement will not be permitted when the temperature is 40E Fahrenheit or under, except with the approval of the Engineer. Such approval will not be given until the Contractor has demonstrated that he has the means to adequately protect the concrete from freezing. Cold weather concrete placement shall be in accordance with the recommendations of ACI 306 and the following.

 **B.** Adequate equipment shall be provided for heating the concrete materials in order to place the concrete at temper­atures between 50E Fahrenheit and 80E Fahrenheit. No frozen materials or materials containing ice shall be used.

 **C.** All concrete materials and all reinforcement, forms, filler and ground with which the concrete is to come in contact shall be free from frost. Adequate means shall be provided for maintaining a temperature of the concrete at not less than 70E Fahrenheit for 3 days or 50E Fahrenheit for 5 days except when high-early-strength concrete is used the temperature shall be maintained at not less than 70E for as much more time as is necessary to insure proper curing of the concrete. The housing, covering or other protection used in connection with curing shall remain in place and intact at least 24 hours after the artificial heating is discontinued. No dependence shall be place on salt or other chemicals for the prevention of freezing.
1. 3.15 Waterproofing of Foundation Walls
    1. Exterior foundation walls below grade shall be primed with one coat of Barrett Carbosote Creosote Oil and two coats of Barrett Waterproofing Pitch, or approved equal. The first coat shall be applied at a rate of 25-30 pounds per hundred square feet, and the second coat at a rate of 20-25 pounds per hundred square feet. Surfaces to be treated must be clean, dry and free of dust or loose particles.
1. 3.16** **Evaluation of Concrete

 **A. General:** Concrete work which does not conform to the
    1. specified requirements, including strength, tolerances, and finishes, shall be corrected as directed by the Engineer at the Contractor's expense, without extension of time there­for.
    1. The Contractor shall also be responsible for the cost of corrections to any other work affected by or resulting from corrections to the concrete work.

 **B. Evaluation of Quality Control Tests:** 

 **1. Compressive Strength Tests** for laboratory cured cylinders will be considered satisfactory if they comply with the requirements of ASTM C94, Section 16. Part of Section 16 reads:
    1. "For concrete, in structures designed by the ultimate strength method and in prestressed structures, not more than 10% of the strength tests shall have values less than the specified strength, /'c, and the average of any three consecutive strength tests shall be equal to or greater than the specified strength."
    1. The required compressive strength of concrete shall be construed to be that class (as specified in paragraph 2 of this section), or strength, indicated on the draw­ings.

 **2. Core Tests:** The testing service shall take core samples of in-lace concrete when test results are such that there is reasonable doubt that the specified concrete strengths and other characteristics have not bee attained in the structure, as directed by the Engineer. The testing service shall conduct tests to determine the strength and other characteristics of the in-place concrete by compression tests on cored cylin­ders complying with ASTM C42, or by load testing speci­fied in ACI 318, or others as conducted and any other additional testing as my be required.

 **C. Formed Concrete Dimensional Tolerances

 **1.** Formed concrete having any dimension smaller or greater than required, and outside the specified toler­ance limits, will be considered deficient in strength and subject to additional testing as herein specified.

 **2.** Formed concrete having any dimension greater than required will be rejected if the appearance or function of the structure is adversely affected, or if the larger dimensions interfere with other construction. Repair, or remove and replace rejected concrete as required to meet the construction conditions. When permitted, accomplish the removal of excessive materi­als in a manner to maintain the strength of the section without affecting the function and appearance.
