2. POLE INSTALLATION
   1. Align pole foundations and poles for optimum directional alignment of luminaires and their mounting provisions on the pole.
   1. Clearances:
      1. Maintain the following minimum horizontal distances of poles from surface and underground features, unless otherwise indicated on Drawings:
      1. Fire Hydrants and Storm Drainage Piping:
         1. 60.
2. Water, Gas, Electric, Communication, and Sewer Lines:
      1. 5 feet.
3. Trees:
      1. 15 feet.
   1. Concrete Pole Foundations:
      1. Set anchor bolts according to anchor-bolt templates furnished by pole manufacturer. Concrete materials, installation, and finishing requirements are specified in Division 03 Section "Cast-in-Place Concrete."
   1. Poles and Pole Foundations Set in Concrete Paved Areas:
      1. Install poles with minimum of 6-inch wide, unpaved gap between the pole or pole foundation and the edge of adjacent concrete slab. Fill unpaved ring with pea gravel to a level 1 inch below top of concrete slab.

3. BOLLARD LUMINAIRE INSTALLATION
   1. Align units for optimum directional alignment of light distribution.
   1. Install on concrete base with top 4 inches above finished grade or surface at bollard location.
Cast conduit into base, and shape base to match shape of bollard base. Finish by troweling and rubbing smooth. Concrete materials, installation, and finishing are specified in Division 03
   1. Section "Cast-in-Place Concrete."
4. INSTALLATION OF INDIVIDUAL GROUND-MOUNTING LUMINAIRES
   1. Install on concrete base with top 4 inches above finished grade or surface at luminaire location.
