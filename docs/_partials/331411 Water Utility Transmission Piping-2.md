## Execution

1. Preparation
   1. The location of all piping and other items shown on the Drawings or called for in the Specifications that are not definitely located by dimensions or elevations, is approximate only. The exact locations and dimensions necessary for proper installation must be determined at the project site. The Contractor and Engineer shall stake the locations of pipe and appurtenances prior to installation.
	1. See MWW Standard for Water and Wastewater Line Crossings, if applicable. 
	2. Pipe Installation
2. General:
      1. Comply with the manufacturer’s recommendations and ANSI/AWWA C 600.
	1. All pipe, joint restraint, fittings, and appurtenances regardless of soil resistivity shall be polyethylene encased in accordance with AWWA C-105. The polyethylene encasement shall cover service lines from the main 3 feet outward and hydrant barrels to the bury line. All metal surfaces and bolts on all valves shall be wrapped up to the operating nut, including all top bonnet bolts. AWWA approved tape materials are the only fastening materials allowed. Duct Tape is not acceptable. The polyethylene encasement shall prevent contact between the pipe and bedding material, but is not intended to be a completely airtight and watertight enclosure. The polyethylene shall have a minimum thickness of 8 mils. A 2-inch wide 10 mil thickness polyethylene pressure-sensitive tape shall be used to close seams or hold overlaps.
	2. Materials shall not be dropped into the trench but shall be lowered by hand or machine. Blocking under the pipe shall not be used.
	3. The interior of all pipe and fittings shall be kept in a clean, sanitary condition at all times. During pipe laying operations, no debris, tools, clothing or other material shall be placed in the pipe. Any foreign material found in the pipe shall be removed prior to jointing. When pipe laying operations are not being conducted, all pipe openings are to be plugged with a watertight plug.
	4. All lumps, blisters and excess coal-tar coating on ductile iron pipe shall be removed from the bell-and -spigot end of each pipe, and the outside of the spigot and the inside of the bell shall be wire-brushed and wiped clean and dry and free from soil and grease before the pipe is laid.
	5. After placing a length of pipe in the trench, the spigot end shall be centered in the bell and the pipe forced home and brought to correct line and grade. Pipe and fittings which do not allow a uniform space for joints shall be removed and replaced with pipe and fittings of proper dimensions to insure such uniform space. Precautions shall be taken to prevent dirt from entering the joint space.
	6. The cutting of pipe for inserting valves, fittings, or closure pieces shall be done in a neat and workmanlike manner leaving a smooth end at right angles to the axis of the pipe. Pipe cutting shall be done without damaging the remainder of the pipe or the cement lining. The flame cutting of pipe by means of an oxyacetylene torch shall not be allowed. The cut end shall be beveled to allow the pipe to be joined without damage to or displacement of the rubber gasket.
	7. The standard depth of cover from finished grade for water mains shall be 7-feet. All appurtenances shall be compatible with a 7-foot depth of cover if not so specified. In areas where water mains are to be installed in conjunction with road construction or overlot grading the rough subgrade shall be constructed prior to installing the water mains or service lines. All service lines shall be staked and constructed so that 7-feet of bury depth is maintained through drainage ditches and other site topographic variables.
	8. Wherever it is necessary to deflect the pipe from a straight line, either in the vertical or horizontal plane, the allowable amount of deflection shall be that indicated in the following Section:

   1. Thrust Blocks:
      1. All plugs, caps, tees, bends and hydrants shall be thrust blocked as required to resist vertical and horizontal reactions. Thrust blocks are to be used in addition to joint restraint. 
	1. The thrust blocks shall extend from the fitting, valve or hydrant to solid undisturbed earth. Form sides of thrust blocks on joint sizes greater than 8” diameter. Thrust blocks shall be installed so all joints are accessible and the concrete does not come in contact with the joint bolts. Newly placed concrete shall be allowed to set, undisturbed, for a minimum of 24 hours at no less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Backfill may be placed over thrust blocks once the surface has set sufficiently to resist the weight of the backfill. However, no tamping or compacting shall be allowed above the thrust block for a minimum of 24 hours after placement. Do not apply internal water pressure to any section of pipe containing concrete thrust blocks until the concrete has cured for at least 48 hours. Where undisturbed trench walls are not available for thrust blocking, the Contractor shall make other provisions for added thrust restraint subject to the Engineer’s review
2. Restrained Joints:
      1. Joint restraint devices shall be used at all bends and fittings. Joint restraint devices shall be required for the following installations:
	1. Fire hydrants
	2. Reducers
	3. Vertical and horizontal offsets
	4. On all bends
	5. Caps and plugs
	6. On the side branch of all tees
	7. Reducers shall be restrained on each side of the fitting. For all other fittings, the required length of pipe to be restrained from the precedent item is as specified in the following table:

	1. Gate Valve and Box Installation
   1. Location:
      1. shall be subject to final approval by the Engineer. Valves shall have the interior cleaned of all foreign matter and shall be inspected in opened and closed positions before installation to insure that all parts are in working condition. A valve box shall be set so that it is centered and plumb over the valve operating nut.
2. Grade:
      1. The Contractor shall be responsible for adjusting the final height of all new valve boxes and curb boxes to the specified levels or as may be directed by the Engineer. The valve boxes shall typically be set to the following grades:
      1. Paved Streets -
   1. 1/2 inch below grade
   1. Gravel roads, shoulders & driveways -
   1. 2-inches below grade
   1. Areas not in road easements or affected by snow plowing operations - 
   1. Set flush to grade or as agreed with Engineer
   1. Valve Operator Nut Riser:
      1. Valve operator nut risers shall be provided on all valves to bring the operating nut to between 6” and 18” of finished grade.
	1. Disinfecting and Flushing
2. The Engineer may require the Contractor to clean and disinfect pipeline materials which have noticeable contamination prior to installation.
3. Disinfect the work in accordance with the procedures outlined in AWWA C651. If calcium hypochlorite tablets are used they must be attached to the top of the inside of the pipe with an adhesive (Permatex #1 or an approved equal). Sufficient tablets must be used to form a minimum of 25 PPM free chlorine at the time of filling. Do not use excessive chlorine. Filling of the water main shall be accomplished at a water velocity less than one foot/second. After 24 hours, the Engineer shall test the chlorine residual. If a minimum residual of 10 PPM is not met, the disinfecting procedure shall be repeated.
4. After disinfecting of the water line(s) has been approved, flush the heavily chlorinated water from the mains until the chlorine residual is no higher than that generally prevailing in the system. Procedures to include de-chlorination if necessary, must be followed to prevent heavily chlorinated water from entering adjacent streams or irrigation ditches. The Owner shall make final tests to determine that chlorine and bacteriological levels are safe before the new water system is approved for domestic use. The final bacteria test must be made no sooner than 6 hours after the line was last flushed. The Contractor shall be responsible for any re-chlorination and flushing necessary to obtain safe bacteriological levels.
5. Several days are required to obtain the results of bacteriological tests. Coordinate the construction schedule around the requirements of bacteriological testing. Mount Werner Water may require passing bacteriological tests on two consecutive days.
6. Flushing shall ensure that sand, rocks or other foreign materials are not left in the pipeline. The contractor shall supply the water necessary for flushing if a sufficient quantity of water is not available from the existing water system. In such a case the Contractor shall present his flushing program to the Engineer before proceeding.
7. Special care shall be taken when disinfecting and flushing sections of new mains to avoid contaminating the existing system or delivering highly chlorinated water to the system.
	1. Quality Control
8. General
	1. Conduct Pressure and leakage tests in accordance with ANSI/AWWA C600.
	2. Notify the Engineer at least 48 hours in advance of conducting tests so that he may be present during the test.
	3. Test completed sections of pipeline as soon as practical after installation. No more than 1,000-feet of pipeline or 10% of the total pipeline (whichever is greater) shall be installed without testing the completed portions.
	4. Check all valves for smooth operation on opening and closing. All boxes shall be centered and plumb and to the grades specified. 
	5. Joints that cannot be pressure tested, such as tie-in points, shall be visually inspected for leaks by the engineer while the joints are charged under static pressure. The Contractor must fully expose these joints for inspection.
	6. Pressure testing against existing valves is strongly discouraged. Mount Werner Water does not warrant the condition of any existing valves.
9. Pressure Test
		1. General: Pressure tests will only be allowed after the main has passed all disinfection and bacteriological tests. After concrete thrust blocks have cured, all newly laid pipe or any valved section thereof shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of 200 PSI for mains 12 inch diameter or less and 150 PSI for mains greater than 12-inch diameter. 
	2. Test Location
		1. Do not test through a fire hydrant.
		2. If a service tap is to be make on the stretch of main to be tested, make the tap and perform the test through the tap.
		3. If no service taps are to be made on the stretch of main to be tested, a temporary test tap is to be made. At the conclusion of the pressure test, the temporary corporation stop shall be removed and plugged. The plugged tap is to be visually inspected for leakage under static pressure prior to backfill.
	3. Test Pressure Restrictions
		1. Do not exceed pipe or thrust-restraint design pressures.
		2. Test shall be of at least two-hour duration.
		3. Pressure shall not vary by more than 5 PSI for the duration of the test.
		4. Do not exceed twice the rated pressure (200 PSI for 12-inch diameter or less and 150 PSI for greater than 12-inch diameter) of the valves or hydrants when the pressure boundary of the test section includes closed solid wedge gate valves or hydrants. Note: Valves shall not be operated in either direction at differential pressure exceeding the rated pressure.
		5. Do not exceed the rated pressure of the valves when the pressure boundary of the test section includes closed resilient-seated gate valves (200 PSI) or butterfly valves (150 PSI).
	4. Air removal: Before applying the specified test pressure, air shall be expelled completely from the pipe, valves, and hydrant. If permanent air vents are not located at all high points, the Contractor shall install corporation cocks at such points so that the air can be expelled as the line is filled with water. After all the air has been expelled, the corporation cocks shall be closed and the test pressure applied.
	5. Pressurization: Each valved section of pipe shall be filled with water slowly and the specified test pressure; based on the elevation of the lowest point of the line or section under test and corrected to the elevation of the test gauge, shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. The test pump must be clean and used with potable water only. Valves shall not be operated in either the opening or closing direction at differential pressures above the rated pressure. It is good practice to allow the system to stabilize at the test pressure before conducting the leakage test.
	6. Examination: Any exposed pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants and joints shall be examined carefully during the test. Any damage or defective pipe, fittings, valves or hydrants that are discovered following the pressure test shall be repaired or replaced with sound material, and the test shall be repeated until it is satisfactory to the Engineer.
10. Leakage Test: The leakage test shall be conducted concurrently with the pressure test.
	1. Leakage defined: Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved section thereof, to maintain pressure within 5 PSI of the specified test pressure after the air in the pipeline has been expelled and the pipe has been filled with water. Leakage shall not be measured by a drop in pressure in a test section over a period of time. 
	2. Allowable leakage for Ductile Iron mains: No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage is greater than that determined by the following formula:
      1. L=
    1. 133,200
    1. in which L is the allowable leakage, in gallons per hour; S is the length of pipe tested in feet; D is the nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches; and P is the average test pressure during leakage test, in pounds per square inch gauge. 

		1. In tabular form, the allowable leakage per 1000 feet of pipeline in gallons per hour for a test pressure of 200 psi is:
      1. Nominal Pipe ID (in.)
   1. Maximum allowable leakage in gallons
   1. per hour per 1000 feet of pipeline
   1. 4”
43.
   1. 6”
64.
   1. 8”
85.
   1. 10”
06.
   1. 12”
28.
   1. When hydrants are in the test section, the test shall be made against the closed hydrant.

	1. When the test section of pipe is 100 LF or less the following applies: The test section shall be tested at 200 PSIG for a minimum period of 1 hour with zero pressure loss. If the assembly losses pressure, then the contractor shall locate and repair the leak and repeat the process until a passing test is observed by the Engineer.
