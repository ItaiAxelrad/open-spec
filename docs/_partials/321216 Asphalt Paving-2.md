   1. Work included:
      1. Work consists of furnishing all labor, material and equipment necessary for completion of the furnishing, laying and compacting Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements (HMAP) in conformance with lines, grades and typical cross sections shown in the details and on the Drawings.
   1. The HMAP shall be hot mixed at a central plant.
   1. Where the specifications and/or on the drawings use "HMAP," "Hot Bituminous Pavement," or "Asphaltic Concrete Pavement", these terms shall mean the same as “Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements.”
   1. Where the specifications and/or the drawings call out Grades C or CX use Grading S or SG.
   1. The following items of the MGPEC Pavement Design Standards & Construction Specifications, Appendix B, Construction Specifications are made an integral part of these Specifications:
      1. Item 0 GENERAL
   1. Item 1 REMOVAL OF EXISTING PAVEMENT
   1. Item 9 HOT MIX ASPHALT PAVEMENT
   1. Item 13 JOINT AND CRACK SEALANT
   1. Item 17 ASPHALT PATCH
   1. The following exceptions to the MGPEG Specifications shall govern in this project.
   1. Measurement and Payment shall be found in Section 01150.
   1. References to the Marshall mix design method and compaction testing are not applicable.

   1. SUBMITTALS
   1. Make submittals in accordance with Section 013300.
   1. Mix Designs:
      1. At least two weeks prior to paving, the Contractor, at his expense, shall submit the mix design for each area of pavement. The Testing Laboratory shall, at the Contractor’s expense, test all materials for compliance with these specifications and establish a job mix formula for each mixture proposed for use on the project. Using the blank copy herein, the Contractor shall include a completed copy of MGPEC Form #9 with each mix design submittal. Each mix design submittal shall include:
      1. Aggregate gradation, specific gravity, LA Abrasion, and physical properties.
   1. Asphalt Cement properties with recommended field compaction temperature limits.
   1. Proposed Design Job Mix.
   1. Mixing and Compaction temperatures.
   1. Mixture properties at a minimum of four asphalt contents
   1. Test Reports:
      1. The Testing Laboratory shall submit to the Owner for approval two hard copies and one electronic copy of a report containing legible copies of all test data, graphs, tables, and charts used to establish the job mix formula as well as MGPEC Form #9. The report shall bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer, licensed in Colorado, and competent in asphalt concrete mix design and construction. In order for a proposed material to be acceptable, the Testing Laboratory must report that the proposed materials and job mix meet or exceed this specification.
   1. Source:
      1. The Contractor shall submit the source and supplier of all materials together with addresses and phone numbers.
   1. PROJECT/SITE CONDITIONS
   1. Do not apply in-laid thermo-plastic marking when surface or air temperature is less than 55 F., or when moisture content of substrate is above manufacturer's recommendations.
