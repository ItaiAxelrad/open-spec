## Execution

1. EXAMINATION
   1. Examine joints indicated to receive joint sealants, with Installer present, for compliance with requirements for joint configuration, installation tolerances, and other conditions affecting joint-sealant performance.
   1. Proceed with installation only after unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.
1. PREPARATION
   1. Surface Cleaning of Joints:
      1. Clean out joints immediately before installing joint sealants to comply with joint-sealant manufacturer's written instructions.
   1. As previously noted in "Primers" Article, purpose of primers is to improve adhesion of joint sealant to substrate.
   1. Joint Priming:
      1. Prime joint substrates where indicated or where recommended in writing by joint-sealant manufacturer, based on preconstruction joint-sealant-substrate tests or prior experience. Apply primer to comply with joint-sealant manufacturer's written instructions. Confine primers to areas of joint-sealant bond; do not allow spillage or migration onto adjoining surfaces.
1. INSTALLATION OF JOINT SEALANTS 1. General: 1. Comply with joint-sealant manufacturer's written installation instructions for products and applications indicated unless more stringent requirements apply.
   1. Joint-Sealant Installation Standard:
      1. Comply with recommendations in ASTM C 1193 for use of joint sealants as applicable to materials, applications, and conditions indicated.
   1. Install joint-sealant backings of kind indicated to support joint sealants during application and at position required to produce cross-sectional shapes and depths of installed sealants relative to joint widths that allow optimum sealant movement capability.
   1. Do not leave gaps between ends of joint-sealant backings.
   1. Do not stretch, twist, puncture, or tear joint-sealant backings.
   1. Remove absorbent joint-sealant backings that have become wet before sealant application and replace them with dry materials.
   1. Install joint sealants using proven techniques that comply with the following and at the same time backings are installed:
      1. Place joint sealants so they directly contact and fully wet joint substrates.
   1. Completely fill recesses in each joint configuration.
   1. Produce uniform, cross-sectional shapes and depths relative to joint widths that allow optimum sealant movement capability.
   1. Tooling of Nonsag Joint Sealants:
      1. Immediately after joint-sealant application and before skinning or curing begins, tool sealants according to the following requirements to form smooth, uniform beads of configuration indicated; to eliminate air pockets; and to ensure contact and adhesion of sealant with sides of joint:
      1. Remove excess joint sealant from surfaces adjacent to joints.
   1. Use tooling agents that are approved in writing by joint-sealant manufacturer and that do not discolor sealants or adjacent surfaces.
   1. Provide joint configuration to comply with joint-sealant manufacturer's written instructions unless otherwise indicated.
   1. CONTRACTION JOINTS
   1. Form weakened-plane contraction joints, sectioning concrete into areas as indicated. Construct contraction joints for a depth equal to at least on-fouth of the concrete thickness, as follows.
   1. Grooved Joints:
      1. Form contraction joints after intial floating by grooving and finishing each edge of joint with grooving tool to a 1/4-inch radius. Repeat grooving of contraction joints after applying surface finishes. Eliminate grooving-tool marks on concrete surfaces.
   1. Tolerances:
      1. Ensure that grooved joints are within 3-inches either way from centers of dowels.
   1. Sawed Joints:
      1. Form contraction joints with power saws equipped with shatterproof abrasive or diamond-rimmed blades. Cut 1/8-inch wide joints into concrete when cutting action will not tear, abrade, or otherwise damage surface and before developing random contraction cracks.
   1. Tolerances:
      1. Ensure that grooved joints are within 3-inches either way from centers of dowels.
   1. Doweled Contraction Joints:
      1. Install dowel bars and support assemblies at joints where indicated. Lubricate or coat with asphalt one-half of dowel length to prevent concrete bonding to one-side of joint.
   1. CLEANING
   1. Clean off excess joint sealant or sealant smears adjacent to joints as the Work progresses, by methods and with cleaning materials approved in writing by manufacturers of joint sealants and of products in which joints occur.
   1. PROTECTION
   1. Protect joint sealants, during and after curing period, from contact with contaminating substances and from damage resulting from construction operations or other causes so sealants are without deterioration or damage at time of Substantial Completion. If, despite such protection, damage or deterioration occurs, cut out and remove damaged or deteriorated joint sealants immediately and replace with joint sealant so installations in repaired areas are indistinguishable from the original work.
