1. _Availability of Lands_
1. Owner shall furnish the Site. Owner shall notify Contractor of any encumbrances or restrictions not of general application but specifically related to use of the Site with which Contractor must comply in performing the Work. Owner will obtain in a timely manner and pay for easements for permanent structures or permanent changes in existing facilities. If Contractor and Owner are unable to agree on entitlement to or on the amount or extent, if any, of any adjustment in the Contract Price or Contract Times, or both, as a result of any delay in Owner’s furnishing the Site or a part thereof, Contractor may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05.
1. Upon reasonable written request, Owner shall furnish Contractor with a current statement of record legal title and legal description of the lands upon which the Work is to be performed and Owner’s interest therein as necessary for giving notice of or filing a mechanic's or construction lien against such lands in accordance with applicable Laws and Regulations.
1. Contractor shall provide for all additional lands and access thereto that may be required for temporary construction facilities or storage of materials and equipment.
1. _Subsurface and Physical Conditions_
1. _Reports and Drawings:_ The Supplementary Conditions identify:
   1. those reports of explorations and tests of subsurface conditions at or contiguous to the Site that Engineer has used in preparing the Contract Documents; and
1. those drawings of physical conditions in or relating to existing surface or subsurface structures at or contiguous to the Site (except Underground Facilities) that Engineer has used in preparing the Contract Documents.
1. _Limited Reliance by Contractor on Technical Data Authorized:_ Contractor may rely upon the general accuracy of the “technical data” contained in such reports and drawings, but such reports and drawings are not Contract Documents. Such “technical data” is identified in the Supplementary Conditions. Except for such reliance on such “technical data,” Contractor may not rely upon or make any claim against Owner or Engineer, or any of their Related Entities with respect to:
   1. the completeness of such reports and drawings for Contractor’s purposes, including, but not limited to, any aspects of the means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures of construction to be employed by Contractor, and safety precautions and programs incident thereto; or
1. other data, interpretations, opinions, and information contained in such reports or shown or indicated in such drawings; or
1. any Contractor interpretation of or conclusion drawn from any "technical data" or any such other data, interpretations, opinions, or information.
1. _Differing Subsurface or Physical Conditions_
1. _Notice:_ If Contractor believes that any subsurface or physical condition at or contiguous to the Site that is uncovered or revealed either:
   1. is of such a nature as to establish that any “technical data” on which Contractor is entitled to rely as provided in Paragraph 4.02 is materially inaccurate; or
1. is of such a nature as to require a change in the Contract Documents; or
1. differs materially from that shown or indicated in the Contract Documents; or
1. is of an unusual nature, and differs materially from conditions ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in the Contract Documents;
1. then Contractor shall, promptly after becoming aware thereof and before further disturbing the subsurface or physical conditions or performing any Work in connection therewith (except in an emergency as required by Paragraph 6.16.A), notify Owner and Engineer in writing about such condition. Contractor shall not further disturb such condition or perform any Work in connection therewith (except as aforesaid) until receipt of written order to do so.
1. _Engineer’s Review_:
   1. After receipt of written notice as required by Paragraph 4.03.A, Engineer will promptly review the pertinent condition, determine the necessity of Owner's obtaining additional exploration or tests with respect thereto, and advise Owner in writing (with a copy to Contractor) of Engineer’s findings and conclusions.
1. Possible Price and Times Adjustments
1. The Contract Price or the Contract Times, or both, will be equitably adjusted to the extent that the existence of such differing subsurface or physical condition causes an increase or decrease in Contractor’s cost of, or time required for, performance of the Work; subject, however, to the following:
   1. such condition must meet any one or more of the categories described in Paragraph 4.03.A; and
   1. with respect to Work that is paid for on a Unit Price Basis, any adjustment in Contract Price will be subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 9.07 and 11.03.
1. Contractor shall not be entitled to any adjustment in the Contract Price or Contract Times if:
   1. Contractor knew of the existence of such conditions at the time Contractor made a final commitment to Owner with respect to Contract Price and Contract Times by the submission of a Bid or becoming bound under a negotiated contract; or
   1. the existence of such condition could reasonably have been discovered or revealed as a result of any examination, investigation, exploration, test, or study of the Site and contiguous areas required by the Bidding Requirements or Contract Documents to be conducted by or for Contractor prior to Contractor's making such final commitment; or
   1. Contractor failed to give the written notice as required by Paragraph 4.03.A.
1. If Owner and Contractor are unable to agree on entitlement to or on the amount or extent, if any, of any adjustment in the Contract Price or Contract Times, or both, a Claim may be made therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05. However, Owner and Engineer, and any of their Related Entities shall not be liable to Contractor for any claims, costs, losses, or damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) sustained by Contractor on or in connection with any other project or anticipated project.
1. _Underground Facilities_
1. _Shown or Indicated:_ The information and data shown or indicated in the Contract Documents with respect to existing Underground Facilities at or contiguous to the Site is based on information and data furnished to Owner or Engineer by the owners of such Underground Facilities, including Owner, or by others. Unless it is otherwise expressly provided in the Supplementary Conditions:
   1. Owner and Engineer shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any such information or data; and
1. the cost of all of the following will be included in the Contract Price, and Contractor shall have full responsibility for:
   1. reviewing and checking all such information and data,
   1. locating all Underground Facilities shown or indicated in the Contract Documents,
   1. coordination of the Work with the owners of such Underground Facilities, including Owner, during construction, and
   1. the safety and protection of all such Underground Facilities and repairing any damage thereto resulting from the Work.
1. \*Not Shown or Indicated 1. If an Underground Facility is uncovered or revealed at or contiguous to the Site which was not shown or indicated, or not shown or indicated with reasonable accuracy in the Contract Documents, Contractor shall, promptly after becoming aware thereof and before further disturbing conditions affected thereby or performing any Work in connection therewith (except in an emergency as required by Paragraph 6.16.A), identify the owner of such Underground Facility and give written notice to that owner and to Owner and Engineer. Engineer will promptly review the Underground Facility and determine the extent, if any, to which a change is required in the Contract Documents to reflect and document the consequences of the existence or location of the Underground Facility. During such time, Contractor shall be responsible for the safety and protection of such Underground Facility.
1. If Engineer concludes that a change in the Contract Documents is required, a Work Change Directive or a Change Order will be issued to reflect and document such consequences. An equitable adjustment shall be made in the Contract Price or Contract Times, or both, to the extent that they are attributable to the existence or location of any Underground Facility that was not shown or indicated or not shown or indicated with reasonable accuracy in the Contract Documents and that Contractor did not know of and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of or to have anticipated. If Owner and Contractor are unable to agree on entitlement to or on the amount or extent, if any, of any such adjustment in Contract Price or Contract Times, Owner or Contractor may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05.
1. _Reference Points_
1. Owner shall provide engineering surveys to establish reference points for construction which in Engineer’s judgment are necessary to enable Contractor to proceed with the Work. Contractor shall be responsible for laying out the Work, shall protect and preserve the established reference points and property monuments, and shall make no changes or relocations without the prior written approval of Owner. Contractor shall report to Engineer whenever any reference point or property monument is lost or destroyed or requires relocation because of necessary changes in grades or locations, and shall be responsible for the accurate replacement or relocation of such reference points or property monuments by professionally qualified personnel.
1. _Hazardous Environmental Condition at Site_
1. _Reports and Drawings:_ Reference is made to the Supplementary Conditions for the identification of those reports and drawings relating to a Hazardous Environmental Condition identified at the Site, if any, that have been utilized by the Engineer in the preparation of the Contract Documents.
1. _Limited Reliance by Contractor on Technical Data Authorized:_ Contractor may rely upon the general accuracy of the “technical data” contained in such reports and drawings, but such reports and drawings are not Contract Documents.

   1. the completeness of such reports and drawings for Contractor’s purposes, including, but not limited to, any aspects of the means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures of construction to be employed by Contractor and safety precautions and programs incident thereto; or
1. other data, interpretations, opinions and information contained in such reports or shown or indicated in such drawings; or
1. any Contractor interpretation of or conclusion drawn from any “technical data” or any such other data, interpretations, opinions or information.
1. Contractor shall not be responsible for any Hazardous Environmental Condition uncovered or revealed at the Site which was not shown or indicated in Drawings or Specifications or identified in the Contract Documents to be within the scope of the Work. Contractor shall be responsible for a Hazardous Environmental Condition created with any materials brought to the Site by Contractor, Subcontractors, Suppliers, or anyone else for whom Contractor is responsible.
1. If Contractor encounters a Hazardous Environmental Condition or if Contractor or anyone for whom Contractor is responsible creates a Hazardous Environmental Condition, Contractor shall immediately:
   1. (i) secure or otherwise isolate such condition; (ii) stop all Work in connection with such condition and in any area affected thereby (except in an emergency as required by Paragraph 6.16.A); and (iii) notify Owner and Engineer (and promptly thereafter confirm such notice in writing). Owner shall promptly consult with Engineer concerning the necessity for Owner to retain a qualified expert to evaluate such condition or take corrective action, if any.
1. Contractor shall not be required to resume Work in connection with such condition or in any affected area until after Owner has obtained any required permits related thereto and delivered to Contractor written notice:
   1. (i) specifying that such condition and any affected area is or has been rendered safe for the resumption of Work; or (ii) specifying any special conditions under which such Work may be resumed safely. If Owner and Contractor cannot agree as to entitlement to or on the amount or extent, if any, of any adjustment in Contract Price or Contract Times, or both, as a result of such Work stoppage or such special conditions under which Work is agreed to be resumed by Contractor, either party may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05.
1. If after receipt of such written notice Contractor does not agree to resume such Work based on a reasonable belief it is unsafe, or does not agree to resume such Work under such special conditions, then Owner may order the portion of the Work that is in the area affected by such condition to be deleted from the Work. If Owner and Contractor cannot agree as to entitlement to or on the amount or extent, if any, of an adjustment in Contract Price or Contract Times as a result of deleting such portion of the Work, then either party may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05. Owner may have such deleted portion of the Work performed by Owner’s own forces or others in accordance with Article 7.
1. To the fullest extent permitted by Laws and Regulations, Owner shall indemnify and hold harmless Contractor, Subcontractors, and Engineer, and the officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, consultants, and subcontractors of each and any of them from and against all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) arising out of or relating to a Hazardous Environmental Condition, provided that such Hazardous Environmental Condition:
   1. (i) was not shown or indicated in the Drawings or Specifications or identified in the Contract Documents to be included within the scope of the Work, and (ii) was not created by Contractor or by anyone for whom Contractor is responsible. Nothing in this Paragraph 4.06. G shall obligate Owner to indemnify any individual or entity from and against the consequences of that individual’s or entity’s own negligence.

   1. _Substitute Construction Methods or Procedures:_ If a specific means, method, technique, sequence, or procedure of construction is expressly required by the Contract Documents, Contractor may furnish or utilize a substitute means, method, technique, sequence, or procedure of construction approved by Engineer. Contractor shall submit sufficient information to allow Engineer, in Engineer’s sole discretion, to determine that the substitute proposed is equivalent to that expressly called for by the Contract Documents. The requirements for review by Engineer will be similar to those provided in Paragraph 6.05.A.2.
   1. _Engineer’s Evaluation:_ Engineer will be allowed a reasonable time within which to evaluate each proposal or submittal made pursuant to Paragraphs 6.05.A and 6.05.B. Engineer may require Contractor to furnish additional data about the proposed substitute item. Engineer will be the sole judge of acceptability. No “or equal” or substitute will be ordered, installed or utilized until Engineer’s review is complete, which will be evidenced by either a Change Order for a substitute or an approved Shop Drawing for an “or equal.” Engineer will advise Contractor in writing of any negative determination.

1. _Access to Work_
1. Owner, Engineer, their consultants and other representatives and personnel of Owner, independent testing laboratories, and governmental agencies with jurisdictional interests will have access to the Site and the Work at reasonable times for their observation, inspecting, and testing.

1. as otherwise specifically provided in the Contract Documents.
1. If Laws or Regulations of any public body having jurisdiction require any Work (or part thereof) specifically to be inspected, tested, or approved by an employee or other representative of such public body, Contractor shall assume full responsibility for arranging and obtaining such inspections, tests, or approvals, pay all costs in connection therewith, and furnish Engineer the required certificates of inspection or approval.
1. Contractor shall be responsible for arranging and obtaining and shall pay all costs in connection with any inspections, tests, or approvals required for Owner’s and Engineer’s acceptance of materials or equipment to be incorporated in the Work; or acceptance of materials, mix designs, or equipment submitted for approval prior to Contractor’s purchase thereof for incorporation in the Work. Such inspections, tests, or approvals shall be performed by organizations acceptable to Owner and Engineer.
1. If any Work (or the work of others) that is to be inspected, tested, or approved is covered by Contractor without written concurrence of Engineer, it must, if requested by Engineer, be uncovered for observation.
1. Uncovering Work as provided in Paragraph 13.03.E shall be at Contractor’s expense unless Contractor has given Engineer timely notice of Contractor’s intention to cover the same and Engineer has not acted with reasonable promptness in response to such notice.
1. _Uncovering Work_
1. If any Work is covered contrary to the written request of Engineer, it must, if requested by Engineer, be uncovered for Engineer’s observation and replaced at Contractor’s expense.
1. If Engineer considers it necessary or advisable that covered Work be observed by Engineer or inspected or tested by others, Contractor, at Engineer’s request, shall uncover, expose, or otherwise make available for observation, inspection, or testing as Engineer may require, that portion of the Work in question, furnishing all necessary labor, material, and equipment.
1. If it is found that the uncovered Work is defective, Contractor shall pay all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) arising out of or relating to such uncovering, exposure, observation, inspection, and testing, and of satisfactory replacement or reconstruction (including but not limited to all costs of repair or replacement of work of others); and Owner shall be entitled to an appropriate decrease in the Contract Price. If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount thereof, Owner may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05.

If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount or extent thereof, Contractor may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05.
1. _Owner May Stop the Work_
1. If the Work is defective, or Contractor fails to supply sufficient skilled workers or suitable materials or equipment, or fails to perform the Work in such a way that the completed Work will conform to the Contract Documents, Owner may order Contractor to stop the Work, or any portion thereof, until the cause for such order has been eliminated; however, this right of Owner to stop the Work shall not give rise to any duty on the part of Owner to exercise this right for the benefit of Contractor, any Subcontractor, any Supplier, any other individual or entity, or any surety for, or employee or agent of any of them.
1. _Correction or Removal of Defective Work_
1. Promptly after receipt of notice, Contractor shall correct all defective Work, whether or not fabricated, installed, or completed, or, if the Work has been rejected by Engineer, remove it from the Project and replace it with Work that is not defective. Contractor shall pay all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) arising out of or relating to such correction or removal (including but not limited to all costs of repair or replacement of work of others).
1. When correcting defective Work under the terms of this Paragraph 13.06 or Paragraph 13.07, Contractor shall take no action that would void or otherwise impair Owner’s special warranty and guarantee, if any, on said Work.
1. _Correction Period_
1. If within one year after the date of Substantial Completion (or such longer period of time as may be prescribed by the terms of any applicable special guarantee required by the Contract Documents) or by any specific provision of the Contract Documents, any Work is found to be defective, or if the repair of any damages to the land or areas made available for Contractor’s use by Owner or permitted by Laws and Regulations as contemplated in Paragraph 6.11.A is found to be defective, Contractor shall promptly, without cost to Owner and in accordance with Owner’s written instructions:
   1. repair such defective land or areas; or
1. correct such defective Work; or
1. if the defective Work has been rejected by Owner, remove it from the Project and replace it with Work that is not defective, and
1. satisfactorily correct or repair or remove and replace any damage to other Work, to the work of others or other land or areas resulting therefrom.
1. If Contractor does not promptly comply with the terms of Owner’s written instructions, or in an emergency where delay would cause serious risk of loss or damage, Owner may have the defective Work corrected or repaired or may have the rejected Work removed and replaced. All claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) arising out of or relating to such correction or repair or such removal and replacement (including but not limited to all costs of repair or replacement of work of others) will be paid by Contractor.
1. In special circumstances where a particular item of equipment is placed in continuous service before Substantial Completion of all the Work, the correction period for that item may start to run from an earlier date if so provided in the Specifications .
1. Where defective Work (and damage to other Work resulting therefrom) has been corrected or removed and replaced under this Paragraph 13.07, the correction period hereunder with respect to such Work will be extended for an additional period of one year after such correction or removal and replacement has been satisfactorily completed.
1. Contractor’s obligations under this Paragraph 13.07 are in addition to any other obligation or warranty. The provisions of this Paragraph 13.07 shall not be construed as a substitute for or a waiver of the provisions of any applicable statute of limitation or repose.
1. _Acceptance of Defective Work_
1. If, instead of requiring correction or removal and replacement of defective Work, Owner (and, prior to Engineer’s recommendation of final payment, Engineer) prefers to accept it, Owner may do so. Contractor shall pay all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) attributable to Owner’s evaluation of and determination to accept such defective Work (such costs to be approved by Engineer as to reasonableness) and the diminished value of the Work to the extent not otherwise paid by Contractor pursuant to this sentence. If any such acceptance occurs prior to Engineer’s recommendation of final payment, a Change Order will be issued incorporating the necessary revisions in the Contract Documents with respect to the Work, and Owner shall be entitled to an appropriate decrease in the Contract Price, reflecting the diminished value of Work so accepted. If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount thereof, Owner may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05. If the acceptance occurs after such recommendation, an appropriate amount will be paid by Contractor to Owner.
1. _Owner May Correct Defective Work_
1. If Contractor fails within a reasonable time after written notice from Engineer to correct defective Work or to remove and replace rejected Work as required by Engineer in accordance with Paragraph 13.06.A, or if Contractor fails to perform the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents, or if Contractor fails to comply with any other provision of the Contract Documents, Owner may, after seven days written notice to Contractor, correct or remedy any such deficiency.
1. In exercising the rights and remedies under this Paragraph 13.09, Owner shall proceed expeditiously. In connection with such corrective or remedial action, Owner may exclude Contractor from all or part of the Site, take possession of all or part of the Work and suspend Contractor’s services related thereto, take possession of Contractor’s tools, appliances, construction equipment and machinery at the Site, and incorporate in the Work all materials and equipment stored at the Site or for which Owner has paid Contractor but which are stored elsewhere. Contractor shall allow Owner, Owner’s representatives, agents and employees, Owner’s other contractors, and Engineer and Engineer’s consultants access to the Site to enable Owner to exercise the rights and remedies under this Paragraph.
1. All claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) incurred or sustained by Owner in exercising the rights and remedies under this Paragraph 13.09 will be charged against Contractor, and a Change Order will be issued incorporating the necessary revisions in the Contract Documents with respect to the Work; and Owner shall be entitled to an appropriate decrease in the Contract Price. If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount of the adjustment, Owner may make a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05. Such claims, costs, losses and damages will include but not be limited to all costs of repair, or replacement of work of others destroyed or damaged by correction, removal, or replacement of Contractor’s defective Work.
1. Contractor shall not be allowed an extension of the Contract Times because of any delay in the performance of the Work attributable to the exercise by Owner of Owner’s rights and remedies under this Paragraph 13.09.
   ARTICLE 14 - PAYMENTS TOCONTRACTOR AND COMPLETION
1. _Schedule of Values_
1. The Schedule of Values established as provided in Paragraph 2.07.A will serve as the basis for progress payments and will be incorporated into a form of Application for Payment acceptable to Engineer. Progress payments on account of Unit Price Work will be based on the number of units completed.
1. _Progress Payments_
1. Applications for Payments
1. At least 20 days before the date established in the Agreement for each progress payment (but not more often than once a month), Contractor shall submit to Engineer for review an Application for Payment filled out and signed by Contractor covering the Work completed as of the date of the Application and accompanied by such supporting documentation as is required by the Contract Documents. If payment is requested on the basis of materials and equipment not incorporated in the Work but delivered and suitably stored at the Site or at another location agreed to in writing, the Application for Payment shall also be accompanied by a bill of sale, invoice, or other documentation warranting that Owner has received the materials and equipment free and clear of all Liens and evidence that the materials and equipment are covered by appropriate property insurance or other arrangements to protect Owner’s interest therein, all of which must be satisfactory to Owner.
1. Beginning with the second Application for Payment, each Application shall include an affidavit of Contractor stating that all previous progress payments received on account of the Work have been applied on account to discharge Contractor’s legitimate obligations associated with prior Applications for Payment.
1. The amount of retainage with respect to progress payments will be as stipulated in the Agreement.
1. _Review of Applications_
1. Engineer will, within 10 days after receipt of each Application for Payment, either indicate in writing a recommendation of payment and present the Application to Owner or return the Application to Contractor indicating in writing Engineer’s reasons for refusing to recommend payment. In the latter case, Contractor may make the necessary corrections and resubmit the Application.
1. Engineer’s recommendation of any payment requested in an Application for Payment will constitute a representation by Engineer to Owner, based on Engineer’s observations on the Site of the executed Work as an experienced and qualified design professional and on Engineer's review of the Application for Payment and the accompanying data and schedules, that to the best of Engineer’s knowledge, information and belief:
   1. the Work has progressed to the point indicated;
   1. the quality of the Work is generally in accordance with the Contract Documents (subject to an evaluation of the Work as a functioning whole prior to or upon Substantial Completion, to the results of any subsequent tests called for in the Contract Documents, to a final determination of quantities and classifications for Unit Price Work under Paragraph 9.07, and to any other qualifications stated in the recommendation); and
   1. the conditions precedent to Contractor’s being entitled to such payment appear to have been fulfilled in so far as it is Engineer’s responsibility to observe the Work.
1. By recommending any such payment Engineer will not thereby be deemed to have represented that:
   1. inspections made to check the quality or the quantity of the Work as it has been performed have been exhaustive, extended to every aspect of the Work in progress, or involved detailed inspections of the Work beyond the responsibilities specifically assigned to Engineer in the Contract Documents; or
   1. that there may not be other matters or issues between the parties that might entitle Contractor to be paid additionally by Owner or entitle Owner to withhold payment to Contractor.
1. Neither Engineer’s review of Contractor’s Work for the purposes of recommending payments nor Engineer’s recommendation of any payment, including final payment, will impose responsibility on Engineer:
   1. to supervise, direct, or control the Work, or
   1. for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, or procedures of construction, or the safety precautions and programs incident thereto, or
   1. for Contractor’s failure to comply with Laws and Regulations applicable to Contractor’s performance of the Work, or
   1. to make any examination to ascertain how or for what purposes Contractor has used the moneys paid on account of the Contract Price, or
   1. to determine that title to any of the Work, materials, or equipment has passed to Owner free and clear of any Liens.
1. Engineer may refuse to recommend the whole or any part of any payment if, in Engineer’s opinion, it would be incorrect to make the representations to Owner stated in Paragraph 14.02.B.2. Engineer may also refuse to recommend any such payment or, because of subsequently discovered evidence or the results of subsequent inspections or tests, revise or revoke any such payment recommendation previously made, to such extent as may be necessary in Engineer’s opinion to protect Owner from loss because:
   1. the Work is defective, or completed Work has been damaged, requiring correction or replacement;
   1. the Contract Price has been reduced by Change Orders;
   1. Owner has been required to correct defective Work or complete Work in accordance with Paragraph 13.09; or
   1. Engineer has actual knowledge of the occurrence of any of the events enumerated in Paragraph 15.02.A.
1. _Payment Becomes Due_
1. Ten days after presentation of the Application for Payment to Owner with Engineer’s recommendation, the amount recommended will (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 14.02.D) become due, and when due will be paid by Owner to Contractor.
1. _Reduction in Payment_
1. Owner may refuse to make payment of the full amount recommended by Engineer because:
   1. claims have been made against Owner on account of Contractor’s performance or furnishing of the Work;
   1. Liens have been filed in connection with the Work, except where Contractor has delivered a specific bond satisfactory to Owner to secure the satisfaction and discharge of such Liens;
   1. there are other items entitling Owner to a set-off against the amount recommended; or
   1. Owner has actual knowledge of the occurrence of any of the events enumerated in Paragraphs 14.02.B.5.a through 14.02.B.5.c or Paragraph 15.02.A.
1. If Owner refuses to make payment of the full amount recommended by Engineer, Owner will give Contractor immediate written notice (with a copy to Engineer) stating the reasons for such action and promptly pay Contractor any amount remaining after deduction of the amount so withheld. Owner shall promptly pay Contractor the amount so withheld, or any adjustment thereto agreed to by Owner and Contractor, when Contractor corrects to Owner’s satisfaction the reasons for such action.
1. If it is subsequently determined that Owner’s refusal of payment was not justified, the amount wrongfully withheld shall be treated as an amount due as determined by Paragraph 14.02.C.1.
1. _Contractor’s Warranty of Title_
1. Contractor warrants and guarantees that title to all Work, materials, and equipment covered by any Application for Payment, whether incorporated in the Project or not, will pass to Owner no later than the time of payment free and clear of all Liens.
1. _Substantial Completion_
1. When Contractor considers the entire Work ready for its intended use Contractor shall notify Owner and Engineer in writing that the entire Work is substantially complete (except for items specifically listed by Contractor as incomplete) and request that Engineer issue a certificate of Substantial Completion.
1. Promptly after Contractor’s notification, , Owner, Contractor, and Engineer shall make an inspection of the Work to determine the status of completion. If Engineer does not consider the Work substantially complete, Engineer will notify Contractor in writing giving the reasons therefor.
1. If Engineer considers the Work substantially complete, Engineer will deliver to Owner a tentative certificate of Substantial Completion which shall fix the date of Substantial Completion. There shall be attached to the certificate a tentative list of items to be completed or corrected before final payment. Owner shall have seven days after receipt of the tentative certificate during which to make written objection to Engineer as to any provisions of the certificate or attached list. If, after considering such objections, Engineer concludes that the Work is not substantially complete, Engineer will within 14 days after submission of the tentative certificate to Owner notify Contractor in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If, after consideration of Owner’s objections, Engineer considers the Work substantially complete, Engineer will within said 14 days execute and deliver to Owner and Contractor a definitive certificate of Substantial Completion (with a revised tentative list of items to be completed or corrected) reflecting such changes from the tentative certificate as Engineer believes justified after consideration of any objections from Owner.
1. At the time of delivery of the tentative certificate of Substantial Completion, Engineer will deliver to Owner and Contractor a written recommendation as to division of responsibilities pending final payment between Owner and Contractor with respect to security, operation, safety, and protection of the Work, maintenance, heat, utilities, insurance, and warranties and guarantees. Unless Owner and Contractor agree otherwise in writing and so inform Engineer in writing prior to Engineer’s issuing the definitive certificate of Substantial Completion, Engineer’s aforesaid recommendation will be binding on Owner and Contractor until final payment.
1. Owner shall have the right to exclude Contractor from the Site after the date of Substantial Completion subject to allowing Contractor reasonable access to complete or correct items on the tentative list.
1. _Partial Utilization_
1. Prior to Substantial Completion of all the Work, Owner may use or occupy any substantially completed part of the Work which has specifically been identified in the Contract Documents, or which Owner, Engineer, and Contractor agree constitutes a separately functioning and usable part of the Work that can be used by Owner for its intended purpose without significant interference with Contractor’s performance of the remainder of the Work, subject to the following conditions.
1. Owner at any time may request Contractor in writing to permit Owner to use or occupy any such part of the Work which Owner believes to be ready for its intended use and substantially complete. If and when Contractor agrees that such part of the Work is substantially complete, Contractor will certify to Owner and Engineer that such part of the Work is substantially complete and request Engineer to issue a certificate of Substantial Completion for that part of the Work.
1. Contractor at any time may notify Owner and Engineer in writing that Contractor considers any such part of the Work ready for its intended use and substantially complete and request Engineer to issue a certificate of Substantial Completion for that part of the Work.
1. Within a reasonable time after either such request, Owner, Contractor, and Engineer shall make an inspection of that part of the Work to determine its status of completion. If Engineer does not consider that part of the Work to be substantially complete, Engineer will notify Owner and Contractor in writing giving the reasons therefor. If Engineer considers that part of the Work to be substantially complete, the provisions of Paragraph 14.04 will apply with respect to certification of Substantial Completion of that part of the Work and the division of responsibility in respect thereof and access thereto.
1. No use or occupancy or separate operation of part of the Work may occur prior to compliance with the requirements of Paragraph 5.10 regarding property insurance.
1. _Final Inspection_
1. Upon written notice from Contractor that the entire Work or an agreed portion thereof is complete, Engineer will promptly make a final inspection with Owner and Contractor and will notify Contractor in writing of all particulars in which this inspection reveals that the Work is incomplete or defective. Contractor shall immediately take such measures as are necessary to complete such Work or remedy such deficiencies.
1. _Final Payment_
1. Application for Payment
1. After Contractor has, in the opinion of Engineer, satisfactorily completed all corrections identified during the final inspection and has delivered, in accordance with the Contract Documents, all maintenance and operating instructions, schedules, guarantees, bonds, certificates or other evidence of insurance certificates of inspection, marked-up record documents (as provided in Paragraph 6.12), and other documents, Contractor may make application for final payment following the procedure for progress payments.
1. The final Application for Payment shall be accompanied (except as previously delivered) by:
   1. all documentation called for in the Contract Documents, including but not limited to the evidence of insurance required by Paragraph 5.04.B.7;
   1. consent of the surety, if any, to final payment;
   1. a list of all Claims against Owner that Contractor believes are unsettled; and
   1. complete and legally effective releases or waivers (satisfactory to Owner) of all Lien rights arising out of or Liens filed in connection with the Work.
1. In lieu of the releases or waivers of Liens specified in Paragraph 14.07.A.2 and as approved by Owner, Contractor may furnish receipts or releases in full and an affidavit of Contractor that:
   1. (i) the releases and receipts include all labor, services, material, and equipment for which a Lien could be filed; and (ii) all payrolls, material and equipment bills, and other indebtedness connected with the Work for which Owner or Owner's property might in any way be responsible have been paid or otherwise satisfied. If any Subcontractor or Supplier fails to furnish such a release or receipt in full, Contractor may furnish a bond or other collateral satisfactory to Owner to indemnify Owner against any Lien.
1. _Engineer’s Review of Application and Acceptance_
1. If, on the basis of Engineer’s observation of the Work during construction and final inspection, and Engineer’s review of the final Application for Payment and accompanying documentation as required by the Contract Documents, Engineer is satisfied that the Work has been completed and Contractor’s other obligations under the Contract Documents have been fulfilled, Engineer will, within ten days after receipt of the final Application for Payment, indicate in writing Engineer’s recommendation of payment and present the Application for Payment to Owner for payment. At the same time Engineer will also give written notice to Owner and Contractor that the Work is acceptable subject to the provisions of Paragraph 14.09. Otherwise, Engineer will return the Application for Payment to Contractor, indicating in writing the reasons for refusing to recommend final payment, in which case Contractor shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit the Application for Payment.
1. Payment Becomes Due
1. Thirty days after the presentation to Owner of the Application for Payment and accompanying documentation, the amount recommended by Engineer, less any sum Owner is entitled to set off against Engineer’s recommendation, including but not limited to liquidated damages, will become due and , will be paid by Owner to Contractor.
1. _Final Completion Delayed_
1. If, through no fault of Contractor, final completion of the Work is significantly delayed, and if Engineer so confirms, Owner shall, upon receipt of Contractor’s final Application for Payment (for Work fully completed and accepted) and recommendation of Engineer, and without terminating the Contract, make payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and accepted. If the remaining balance to be held by Owner for Work not fully completed or corrected is less than the retainage stipulated in the Agreement, and if bonds have been furnished as required in Paragraph 5.01, the written consent of the surety to the payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and accepted shall be submitted by Contractor to Engineer with the Application for such payment. Such payment shall be made under the terms and conditions governing final payment, except that it shall not constitute a waiver of Claims.
1. _Waiver of Claims_
1. The making and acceptance of final payment will constitute:
   1. a waiver of all Claims by Owner against Contractor, except Claims arising from unsettled Liens, from defective Work appearing after final inspection pursuant to Paragraph 14.06, from failure to comply with the Contract Documents or the terms of any special guarantees specified therein, or from Contractor’s continuing obligations under the Contract Documents; and
1. a waiver of all Claims by Contractor against Owner other than those previously made in accordance with the requirements herein and expressly acknowledged by Owner in writing as still unsettled.
1. ARTICLE 15 - SUSPENSION OF WORK AND TERMINATION
1. _Owner May Suspend Work_
1. At any time and without cause, Owner may suspend the Work or any portion thereof for a period of not more than 90 consecutive days by notice in writing to Contractor and Engineer which will fix the date on which Work will be resumed. Contractor shall resume the Work on the date so fixed. Contractor shall be granted an adjustment in the Contract Price or an extension of the Contract Times, or both, directly attributable to any such suspension if Contractor makes a Claim therefor as provided in Paragraph 10.05.
1. _Owner May Terminate for Cause_
1. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events will justify termination for cause:
   1. Contractor’s persistent failure to perform the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents (including, but not limited to, failure to supply sufficient skilled workers or suitable materials or equipment or failure to adhere to the Progress Schedule established under Paragraph 2.07 as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Paragraph 6.04);
1. Contractor’s disregard of Laws or Regulations of any public body having jurisdiction;
1. Contractor’s disregard of the authority of Engineer; or
1. Contractor’s violation in any substantial way of any provisions of the Contract Documents.
1. If one or more of the events identified in Paragraph 15.02.A occur, Owner may, after giving Contractor (and surety ) seven days written notice of its intent to terminate the services of Contractor:
   1. exclude Contractor from the Site, and take possession of the Work and of all Contractor’s tools, appliances, construction equipment, and machinery at the Site, and use the same to the full extent they could be used by Contractor (without liability to Contractor for trespass or conversion),
1. incorporate in the Work all materials and equipment stored at the Site or for which Owner has paid Contractor but which are stored elsewhere, and
1. complete the Work as Owner may deem expedient.
1. If Owner proceeds as provided in Paragraph 15.02.B, Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is completed. If the unpaid balance of the Contract Price exceeds all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) sustained by Owner arising out of or relating to completing the Work, such excess will be paid to Contractor. If such claims, costs, losses, and damages exceed such unpaid balance, Contractor shall pay the difference to Owner. Such claims, costs, losses, and damages incurred by Owner will be reviewed by Engineer as to their reasonableness and, when so approved by Engineer, incorporated in a Change Order. When exercising any rights or remedies under this Paragraph Owner shall not be required to obtain the lowest price for the Work performed.
1. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 15.02.B and 15.02.C, Contractor’s services will not be terminated if Contractor begins within seven days of receipt of notice of intent to terminate to correct its failure to perform and proceeds diligently to cure such failure within no more than 30 days of receipt of said notice.
1. Where Contractor’s services have been so terminated by Owner, the termination will not affect any rights or remedies of Owner against Contractor then existing or which may thereafter accrue. Any retention or payment of moneys due Contractor by Owner will not release Contractor from liability.
1. If and to the extent that Contractor has provided a performance bond under the provisions of Paragraph 5.01.A, the termination procedures of that bond shall supersede the provisions of Paragraphs 15.02.B, and 15.02.C.
1. _Owner May Terminate For Convenience_
1. Upon seven days written notice to Contractor and Engineer, Owner may, without cause and without prejudice to any other right or remedy of Owner, terminate the Contract. In such case, Contractor shall be paid for (without duplication of any items):
   1. completed and acceptable Work executed in accordance with the Contract Documents prior to the effective date of termination, including fair and reasonable sums for overhead and profit on such Work;
1. expenses sustained prior to the effective date of termination in performing services and furnishing labor, materials, or equipment as required by the Contract Documents in connection with uncompleted Work, plus fair and reasonable sums for overhead and profit on such expenses;
1. all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and all court or arbitration or other dispute resolution costs) incurred in settlement of terminated contracts with Subcontractors, Suppliers, and others; and
1. reasonable expenses directly attributable to termination.
1. Contractor shall not be paid on account of loss of anticipated profits or revenue or other economic loss arising out of or resulting from such termination.
1. _Contractor May Stop Work or Terminate_
1. If, through no act or fault of Contractor, (i) the Work is suspended for more than 90 consecutive days by Owner or under an order of court or other public authority, or (ii) Engineer fails to act on any Application for Payment within 30 days after it is submitted, or (iii) Owner fails for 30 days to pay Contractor any sum finally determined to be due, then Contractor may, upon seven days written notice to Owner and Engineer, and provided Owner or Engineer do not remedy such suspension or failure within that time, terminate the Contract and recover from Owner payment on the same terms as provided in Paragraph 15.03.
1. In lieu of terminating the Contract and without prejudice to any other right or remedy, if Engineer has failed to act on an Application for Payment within 30 days after it is submitted, or Owner has failed for 30 days to pay Contractor any sum finally determined to be due, Contractor may, seven days after written notice to Owner and Engineer, stop the Work until payment is made of all such amounts due Contractor, including interest thereon. The provisions of this Paragraph 15.04 are not intended to preclude Contractor from making a Claim under Paragraph 10.05 for an adjustment in Contract Price or Contract Times or otherwise for expenses or damage directly attributable to Contractor’s stopping the Work as permitted by this Paragraph.
   ARTICLE 16 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION
1. _Methods and Procedures_
1. Either Owner or Contractor may request mediation of any Claim submitted to Engineer for a decision under Paragraph 10.05 before such decision becomes final and binding. The mediation will be governed by the Construction Industry Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the Effective Date of the Agreement. The request for mediation shall be submitted in writing to the American Arbitration Association and the other party to the Contract. Timely submission of the request shall stay the effect of Paragraph 10.05.E.
1. Owner and Contractor shall participate in the mediation process in good faith. The process shall be concluded within 60 days of filing of the request. The date of termination of the mediation shall be determined by application of the mediation rules referenced above.
1. If the Claim is not resolved by mediation, Engineer’s action under Paragraph 10.05.C or a denial pursuant to Paragraphs 10.05.C.3 or 10.05.D shall become final and binding 30 days after termination of the mediation unless, within that time period, Owner or Contractor:
   1. elects in writing to invoke any dispute resolution process provided for in the Supplementary Conditions, or
1. agrees with the other party to submit the Claim to another dispute resolution process, or
1. gives written notice to the other party of their intent to submit the Claim to a court of competent jurisdiction.
1. ARTICLE 17 - MISCELLANEOUS
