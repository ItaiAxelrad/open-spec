In these areas, backfill the excavation to the elevation indicated or within 3 feet of the finished grade and remove the remaining exposed portion of the shoring before completing the backfill.
   1. Drainage and Dewatering
1. The collection and disposal of surface and subsurface water encountered during construction shall be provided.
      1. Drainage
(i) So that construction operations progress successfully, construction site during shall be completely drained during periods of construction to keep soil materials sufficiently dry. The Contractor shall establish/construct storm drainage features (ponds/basins) at the earliest stages of site development, and throughout construction grade the construction area to provide positive surface water runoff away from the construction activity and/or provide temporary ditches, dikes, swales, and other drainage features and equipment as required to maintain dry soils, prevent erosion and undermining of foundations. When unsuitable working platforms for equipment operation and unsuitable soil support for subsequent construction features develop, remove unsuitable material and provide new soil material as specified herein. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to assess the soil and ground water conditions presented by the plans and specifications and to employ necessary measures to permit construction to proceed. Excavated slopes and backfill surfaces shall be protected to prevent erosion and sloughing. Excavation shall be performed so that the site, the area immediately surrounding the site, and the area affecting operations at the site shall be continually and effectively drained.
      1. Dewatering
(i) Groundwater flowing toward or into excavations shall be controlled to prevent sloughing of excavation slopes and walls, boils, uplift and heave in the excavation and to eliminate interference with orderly progress of construction. French drains, sumps, ditches or trenches will not be permitted within 3 feet of the foundation of any structure, except with specific written approval, and after specific contractual provisions for restoration of the foundation area have been made. Control measures shall be taken by the time the excavation reaches the water level in order to maintain the integrity of the in situ material. While the excavation is open, the water level shall be maintained continuously, at least below the working level.

(ii) Dewatering system shall be operated continuously until construction work below existing water levels is complete. Submit performance records weekly. Measure and record performance of dewatering system at same time each day by use of observation wells or piezometers installed in conjunction with the dewatering system. Relieve hydrostatic head in previous zones below subgrade elevation in layered soils to prevent uplift.
   1. Underground Utilities
1. Location of the existing utilities indicated is approximate. The Contractor shall physically verify the location and elevation of the existing utilities indicated prior to starting construction. The Contractor shall contact the Colorado Utility Notification Center or responsible agency for assistance in locating existing utilities. The Contractor shall scan the construction site with electromagnetic and sonic equipment and mark the surface of the ground where existing underground utilities are discovered.
   1. Machinery and Equipment

Unless indicated otherwise, trees, stumps, logs, shrubs, brush and vegetation and other items that would interfere with construction operations within the clearing limits or within lines (5 feet) outside of each building and structure line shall be removed. Remove stumps entirely. Grub out matted roots and roots over 2 inches in diameter to at least 18 inches below existing surface.
   1. Stripping
1. Suitable soil shall be stripped from the site where excavation or grading is indicated and stockpile separately from other excavated material. Material unsuitable for use as topsoil shall be wasted or shall be stockpiled and used for backfilling. Locate topsoil so that the material can be used readily for the finished grading. Where sufficient existing topsoil conforming to the material requirements is not available on site, provide borrow materials suitable for use as topsoil. Protect topsoil and keep in segregated piles until needed.
   1. Unsuitable Material
1. Remove vegetation, debris, decayed vegetable matter, sod, mulch, and rubbish underneath paved areas or concrete slabs.
3. EXCAVATION
   1. Excavate to contours, elevation, and dimensions indicated. Excavated materials that meet the specified requirements for the material type required at the intended location shall be reused. Keep excavations free from water. Excavate soil disturbed or weakened by Contractor's operations, soils softened or made unsuitable for subsequent construction due to exposure to weather. Excavations below indicated depths will not be permitted except to remove unsatisfactory material. Unsatisfactory material encountered below the grades shown shall be removed as directed. Refill with backfill and fill material or satisfactory material select material porous fill and compact to 95 percent of ASTM D 1557 maximum density. Unless specified otherwise, refill excavations cut below indicated depth with backfill and fill material satisfactory material select material porous fill and compact to 95 percent of, ASTM D 1557 maximum density. Satisfactory material removed below the depths indicated, without specific direction of the Owner, shall be replaced with satisfactory materials to the indicated excavation grade; except as specified for spread footings. Determination of elevations and measurements of approved overdepth excavation of unsatisfactory material below grades indicated shall be done under the direction of the Owner.
   1. Structures With Spread Footings
1. Ensure that footing subgrades have been inspected and approved by the Owner prior to concrete placement. Fill over excavations with concrete during foundation placement.
   1. Pile Cap Excavation and Backfilling
1. Excavate to bottom of pile cap prior to placing or driving piles, unless authorized otherwise by the Owner. Backfill and compact overexcavations and changes in grade due to pile driving operations to 95 percent of ASTM D 1557 maximum density.
   1. Pipe Trenches
1. Excavate to the dimension indicated. Grade bottom of trenches to provide uniform support for each section of pipe after pipe bedding placement. Tamp if necessary to provide a firm pipe bed. Recesses shall be excavated to accommodate bells and joints so that pipe will be uniformly supported for the entire length. Rock, where encountered, shall be excavated to a depth of at least 6 inches below the bottom of the pipe.
   1. Hard Material and Rock Excavation
1. Remove hard material and rock to elevations indicated in a manner that will leave foundation material in an unshattered and solid condition. Roughen level surfaces and cut sloped surfaces into benches for bond with concrete. Protect shale from conditions causing decomposition along joints or cleavage planes and other types of erosion. Removal of hard material and rock beyond lines and grades indicated will not be grounds for a claim for additional payment unless previously authorized by the Contracting Officer. Excavation of the material claimed as rock shall not be performed until the material has been cross sectioned by the Contractor and approved by the Owner. Common excavation shall consist of all excavation not classified as rock excavation.
   1. Excavated Materials
