Gutter forms shall not be removed while the concrete is sufficiently plastic to slump in any direction.
1. SIDEWALK CONCRETE PLACEMENT AND FINISHING
   1. Formed Sidewalks
1. Concrete shall be placed in the forms in one layer. When consolidated and finished, the sidewalks shall be of the thickness indicated. After concrete has been placed in the forms, a strike-off guided by side forms shall be used to bring the surface to proper section to be compacted. The concrete shall be consolidated with an approved vibrator, and the surface shall be finished to grade with a strike off.
   1. Concrete Finishing
1. After straightedging, when most of the water sheen has disappeared, and just before the concrete hardens, the surface shall be finished with a wood float or darby to a smooth and uniformly fine granular or sandy texture free of waves, irregularities, or tool marks. A scored surface shall be produced by brooming with a fiber-bristle brush in a direction transverse to that of the traffic, followed by edging.
   1. Edge and Joint Finishing
1. All slab edges, including those at formed joints, shall be finished with an edger having a radius of 1/8 inch. Transverse joint shall be edged before brooming, and the brooming shall eliminate the flat surface left by the surface face of the edger. Corners and edges which have crumbled and areas which lack sufficient mortar for proper finishing shall be cleaned and filled solidly with a properly proportioned mortar mixture and then finished.
   1. Surface and Thickness Tolerances
1. Finished surfaces shall not vary more than 5/16 inch from the testing edge of a 10-foot straightedge. Permissible deficiency in section thickness shall be up to 1/4 inch.

1. SIDEWALK JOINTS
   1. Sidewalk joints shall be constructed to divide the surface into rectangular areas. Transverse contraction joints shall be spaced at a distance equal to the sidewalk width or 5 feet on centers, whichever is less, and shall be continuous across the slab. Longitudinal contraction joints shall be constructed along the centerline of all sidewalks 10 feet or more in width. Transverse expansion joints shall be installed at sidewalk returns and opposite expansion joints in adjoining curbs. Where the sidewalk is not in contact with the curb, transverse expansion joints shall be installed as indicated. Expansion joints shall be formed about structures and features which project through or into the sidewalk pavement, using joint filler of the type, thickness, and width indicated. Expansion joints shall be spaced at approximately every 50 linear feet for sidewalk construction.
   1. Sidewalk Contraction Joints
1. The contraction joints shall be formed in the fresh concrete by cutting a groove in the top portion of the slab to a depth of at least one-fourth of the sidewalk slab thickness, using a jointer to cut the groove, or by sawing a groove in the hardened concrete with a power-driven saw, unless otherwise approved. Sawed joints shall be constructed by sawing a groove in the concrete with a 1/8 inch blade to the depth indicated. An ample supply of saw blades shall be available on the job before concrete placement is started, and at least one standby sawing unit in good working order shall be available at the jobsite at all times during the sawing operations.
   1. Sidewalk Expansion Joints
1. Expansion joints shall be formed with 1/2 inch joint filler strips. Joint filler in expansion joints surrounding structures and features within the sidewalk may consist of preformed filler material conforming to ASTM D 1752 or building paper. Joint filler shall be held in place with steel pins or other devices to prevent warping of the filler during floating and finishing. Immediately after finishing operations are completed, joint edges shall be rounded with an edging tool having a radius of 1/8 inch, and concrete over the joint filler shall be removed. At the end of the curing period, expansion joints shall be cleaned and filled with cold-applied joint sealant. Joint sealant shall be gray or stone in color. Joints shall be sealed as specified in Section 32 01 19 FIELD MOLDED SEALANTS FOR SEALING JOINTS IN RIGID PAVEMENTS.

Contraction joints shall be constructed by means of 1/8 inch thick separators and of a section conforming to the cross section of the curb and gutter. Separators shall be removed as soon as practicable after concrete has set sufficiently to preserve the width and shape of the joint and prior to finishing.
   1. Contraction joints (except for slip forming) shall be constructed by means of 1/8 inch thick separators and of a section conforming to the cross section of the curb and gutter. Separators shall be removed as soon as practicable after concrete has set sufficiently to preserve the width and shape of the joint and prior to finishing.
   1. When slip forming is used, the contraction joints shall be cut in the top portion of the gutter/curb hardened concrete in a continuous cut across the curb and gutter, using a powerdriven saw. The depth of cut shall be at least one-fourth of the gutter/curb depth and 1/8 inch in width.
   1. Expansion Joints
1. Expansion joints shall be formed by means of preformed expansion joint filler material cut and shaped to the cross section of curb and gutter. Expansion joints shall be provided in curb and gutter directly opposite expansion joints of abutting portland cement concrete pavement, and shall be of the same type and thickness as joints in the pavement. Where curb and gutter do not abut portland cement concrete pavement, expansion joints at least 1/2 inch in width shall be provided at intervals not less than 30 feet or greater than 120 feet. Expansion joints shall be provided in nonreinforced concrete gutter at locations indicated. Expansion joints shall be sealed immediately following curing of the concrete or as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit. Joints shall be sealed as specified in Section 32 01 19 FIELD MOLDED SEALANTS FOR SEALING JOINTS IN RIGID PAVEMENTS.
1. CURING AND PROTECTION
1. General Requirements
1. Concrete shall be protected against loss of moisture and rapid temperature changes for at least 7 days from the beginning of the curing operation. Unhardened concrete shall be protected from rain and flowing water. All equipment needed for adequate curing and protection of the concrete shall be on hand and ready for use before actual concrete placement begins. Protection shall be provided as necessary to prevent cracking of the pavement due to temperature changes during the curing period. 1. Mat Method
   (i) The entire exposed surface shall be covered with 2 or more layers of burlap. Mats shall overlap each other at least 6 inches. The mat shall be thoroughly wetted with water prior to placing on concrete surface and shall be kept continuously in a saturated condition and in intimate contact with concrete for not less than 7 days. 1. Impervious Sheeting Method
   (i) The entire exposed surface shall be wetted with a fine spray of water and then covered with impervious sheeting material. Sheets shall be laid directly on the concrete surface with the light-colored side up and overlapped 12 inches when a continuous sheet is not used. The curing medium shall not be less than 18 inches wider than the concrete surface to be cured, and shall be securely weighted down by heavy wood planks, or a bank of moist earth placed along edges and laps in the sheets. Sheets shall be satisfactorily repaired or replaced if torn or otherwise damaged during curing. The curing medium shall remain on the concrete surface to be cured for not less than 7 days. 1. Membrane Curing Method
   (i) A uniform coating of white-pigmented membrane-curing compound shall be applied to the entire exposed surface of the concrete as soon after finishing as the free water has disappeared from the finished surface. Formed surfaces shall be coated immediately after the forms are removed and in no case longer than 1 hour after the removal of forms. Concrete shall not be allowed to dry before the application of the membrane. If any drying has occurred, the surface of the concrete shall be moistened with a fine spray of water and the curing compound applied as soon as the free water disappears. Curing compound shall be applied in two coats by hand-operated pressure sprayers at a coverage of approximately 200 square feet/gallon for the total of both coats. The second coat shall be applied in a direction approximately at right angles to the direction of application of the first coat. The compound shall form a uniform, continuous, coherent film that shall not check, crack, or peel and shall be free from pinholes or other imperfections. If pinholes, abrasion, or other discontinuities exist, an additional coat shall be applied to the affected areas within 30 minutes. Concrete surfaces that are subjected to heavy rainfall within 3 hours after the curing compound has been applied shall be resprayed by the method and at the coverage specified above. Areas where the curing compound is damaged by subsequent construction operations within the curing period shall be resprayed. Necessary precautions shall be taken to insure that the concrete is properly cured at sawed joints, and that no curing compound enters the joints. The top of the joint opening and the joint groove at exposed edges shall be tightly sealed before the concrete in the region of the joint is resprayed with curing compound. The method used for sealing the joint groove shall prevent loss of moisture from the joint during the entire specified curing period. Approved standby facilities for curing concrete pavement shall be provided at a location accessible to the jobsite for use in the event of mechanical failure of the spraying equipment or other conditions that might prevent correct application of the membrane-curing compound at the proper time. Concrete surfaces to which membrane-curing compounds have been applied shall be adequately protected during the entire curing period from pedestrian and vehicular traffic, except as required for joint-sawing operations and surface tests, and from any other possible damage to the continuity of the membrane.

1. After curing, debris shall be removed and the area adjoining the concrete shall be backfilled, graded, and compacted to conform to the surrounding area in accordance with lines and grades indicated.
   1. Protection
1. Completed concrete shall be protected from damage until accepted. The Contractor shall repair damaged concrete and clean concrete discolored during construction. Concrete that is damaged shall be removed and reconstructed for the entire length between regularly scheduled joints. Refinishing the damaged portion shall not be acceptable. Removed damaged portions shall be disposed of as directed.
   1. Protective Coating
1. Protective coating, of linseed oil mixture, shall be applied to the exposed-to-view concrete surface after the curing period, if concrete shall be exposed to de-icing chemicals within 6 weeks after placement. Concrete to receive a protective coating shall be moist cured. 1. Application
   (i) Curing and backfilling operation shall be completed prior to applying two coats of protective coating. Concrete shall be surface dry and clean before each application. Coverage shall be by spray application at not more than 50 square yards/gallon for first application and not more than 70 square yards/gallon for second application, except that the number of applications and coverage for each application for commercially prepared mixture shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Coated surfaces shall be protected from vehicular and pedestrian traffic until dry. 1. Precautions
   (i) Protective coating shall not be heated by direct application of flame or electrical heaters and shall be protected from exposure to open flame, sparks, and fire adjacent to open containers or applicators. Material shall not be applied at ambient or material temperatures lower than 50 degrees F.
1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL

1. The Contractor shall perform the inspection and tests described and meet the specified requirements for inspection details and frequency of testing. Based upon the results of these inspections and tests, the Contractor shall take the action and submit reports as required below, and any additional tests to insure that the requirements of these specifications are met.
   1. Concrete Testing
1. Strength Testing
   1. The Contractor shall provide molded concrete specimens for strength tests. Samples of concrete placed each day shall be taken not less than once a day nor less than once for every 250 cubic yards of concrete. The samples for strength tests shall be taken in accordance with ASTM C 172. Cylinders for acceptance shall be molded in conformance with ASTM C 31/C 31M by an approved testing laboratory. Each strength test result shall be the average of 2 test cylinders from the same concrete sample tested at 28 days, unless otherwise specified or approved. Concrete specified on the basis of compressive strength shall be considered satisfactory if the averages of all sets of three consecutive strength test results equal or exceed the specified strength, and no individual strength test result falls below the specified strength by more than 500 psi.
1. Air Content
   1. Air content shall be determined in accordance with ASTM C 173/C 173M or ASTM C 231. ASTM C 231 shall be used with concretes and mortars made with relatively dense natural aggregates. Two tests for air content shall be made on randomly selected batches of each class of concrete placed during each shift. Additional tests shall be made when excessive variation in concrete workability is reported by the placing foreman or the Government inspector. If results are out of tolerance, the placing foreman shall be notified and he shall take appropriate action to have the air content corrected at the plant. Additional tests for air content shall be performed on each truckload of material until such time as the air content is within the tolerance specified.
1. Slump Test
   1. Two slump tests shall be made on randomly selected batches of each class of concrete for every 250 cubic yards, or fraction thereof, of concrete placed during each shift. Additional tests shall be performed when excessive variation in the workability of the concrete is noted or when excessive crumbling or slumping is noted along the edges of slip-formed concrete.
   1. Thickness Evaluation
1. The anticipated thickness of the concrete shall be determined prior to placement by passing a template through the formed section or by measuring the depth of opening of the extrusion template of the curb forming machine. If a slip form paver is used for sidewalk placement, the subgrade shall be true to grade prior to concrete placement and the thickness shall be determined by measuring each edge of the completed slab.
   1. Surface Evaluation
1. The finished surface of each category of the completed work shall be uniform in color and free of blemishes and form or tool marks.
1. SURFACE DEFICIENCIES AND CORRECTIONS
   1. Thickness Deficiency
1. When measurements indicate that the completed concrete section is deficient in thickness by more than 1/4 inch the deficient section shall be removed, between regularly scheduled joints, and replaced.
   1. High Areas
1. In areas not meeting surface smoothness and plan grade requirements, high areas shall be reduced either by rubbing the freshly finished concrete with carborundum brick and water when the concrete is less than 36 hours old or by grinding the hardened concrete with an approved surface grinding machine after the concrete is 36 hours old or more. The area corrected by grinding the surface of the hardened concrete shall not exceed 5 percent of the area of any integral slab, and the depth of grinding shall not exceed 1/4 inch. Pavement areas requiring grade or surface smoothness corrections in excess of the limits specified above shall be removed and replaced.
   1. Appearance
1. Exposed surfaces of the finished work shall be inspected by the Owner and any deficiencies in appearance shall be identified. Areas which exhibit excessive cracking, discoloration, form marks, or tool marks or which are otherwise inconsistent with the overall appearances of the work shall be removed and replaced.
