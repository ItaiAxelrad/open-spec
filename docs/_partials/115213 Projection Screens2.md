   1. partitions.
   1. Product
1. ELECTRICALLY OPERATED PROJECTION SCREENS
	1. General:
      1. Manufacturer's standard units consisting of case, screen, motor, controls, mounting
accessories, and other components necessary for a complete installation. Provide units that are
   1. listed and labeled as an assembly by UL or another testing and inspecting agency acceptable to
   1. authorities having jurisdiction.
1. Controls:
      1. Remote, three-position control switch installed in recessed device box with
   1. flush cover plate matching other electrical device cover plates in room where switch is
   1. installed.
      1. Provide one control switches for each screen.
2. Motor in Roller:
      1. Instant-reversing motor of size and capacity recommended by screen
   1. manufacturer; with permanently lubricated ball bearings, automatic thermal-overload
   1. protection, preset limit switches to automatically stop screen in up and down positions,
   1. and positive-stop action to prevent coasting. Mount motor inside roller with vibration
   1. isolators to reduce noise transmission.
3. Screen Mounting:
      1. Top edge securely anchored to rigid metal roller and bottom edge
   1. formed into a pocket holding a 3/8-inch diameter metal rod with ends of rod protected by
   1. plastic caps.
      1. Roller for motor in roller supported by vibration- and noise-absorbing supports.
   1. Recessed-Mounted, Metal-Encased, Electrically Operated Screens:
      1. Motor-in-roller units
designed and fabricated for surface mounting in ceiling, fabricated from formed-steel sheet not
   1. less than 0.027 inch thick or from aluminum extrusions; with flat back design and vinyl
   1. covering or baked-enamel finish. Provide with matching end caps and concealed mounting.
1. Basis-of-Design Product:
      1. Design for the projection screen is based on Da-Lite Screen
   1. Company, Boardroom Electrol. Subject to compliance with requirements of the contract
   1. documents and in accordance with the provisions of Section “Product Requirements”,
   1. provide the named product or an approved equal.
2. Sizes:

## Execution

1. PROJECTION SCREEN INSTALLATION
   1. Install projection screens at locations indicated to comply with screen manufacturer's written
instructions.
   1. Install projection screens with screen cases in position and in relation to adjoining construction
      1. Securely anchor to supporting substrate in a manner that produces a smoothly
operating screen with vertical edges plumb and viewing surface flat when screen is lowered.
1. Install low-voltage controls according to NFPA 70 and complying with manufacturer's
   1. written instructions.
      1. Wiring Method:
         1. Install wiring in raceway except in accessible ceiling spaces and
in gypsum board partitions where unenclosed wiring method may be used. Use
   1. UL-listed plenum cable in environmental air spaces, including plenum ceilings.
   1. Conceal raceway and cables except in unfinished spaces.
2. Test electrically operated units to verify that screen controls, limit switches, closures, and
   1. other operating components are in optimum functioning condition.
3. Test manually operated units to verify that screen-operating components are in optimum
   1. functioning condition.
