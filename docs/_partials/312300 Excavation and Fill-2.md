1. Sample backfill material by ASTM D 75.
1. Express "relative compaction" as a percentage of the ratio of the in-place dry density to the laboratory maximum dry density.
   1. A report of all soils tests performed shall be stamped and signed by the soils firm or individual and shall be submitted prior to the filing of the Notice of Completion by the City. The report shall document the sampling and testing of materials, the location and results of all tests performed, and shall certify that materials and work are in compliance with this specification.

25. If the backfill fails to meet the specified relative compaction requirements; the backfill shall be reworked until the requirements are met. All necessary excavations for density tests shall be made as directed by the Soils Technician, and as acceptable to the City Engineer. The requirements of the Agency having jurisdiction shall prevail on all public roads.
26. Compaction tests shall be performed at random depths, and at random intervals not to exceed 150’, as directed by the Soils Technician or City Engineer.
27. Relative compaction shall be determined by the impact or field compaction test made in accordance with ASTM D 1557 Procedure C.

33. PIPE ZONE BACKFILL

    1. Care shall be taken in placing the imported granular backfill material simultaneously around the main pipeline and appurtenance pipes so that the pipe barrel is completely supported and that no voids or uncompacted areas are left beneath the pipe or on the sides of the pipe. Care shall be taken to place material simultaneously on both sides of the pipe to prevent lateral movement. This area shall be mechanically compacted to attain 90% relative density. Care shall be taken when compacting appurtenance laterals 2” and smaller to prevent the crushing or denting of the copper lateral. Additional lifts of 12" or less thickness may be required on 16" or larger diameter pipe to attain complete support of the haunch area. Soils tests may be taken on this layer of backfill.
    2. After the spring line backfill has been approved by the Soils Technician, backfill of the remainder of the Pipe Zone may proceed. Do not drop sharp, heavy pieces of material directly onto the pipe or the tamped material around the pipe.
    3. Place and compact the imported granular material at a maximum of 12” lifts. Compact all material placed in the Pipe Zone by mechanical methods. Sand cone tests shall be taken on this layer of backfill.
    4. The use of a backhoe-mounted compaction wheel is prohibited within the pipe zone to 12” above the top of the pipe.
    5. Under no circumstances shall consolidation by water settling or water-setting methods (i.e. jetting, diking, etc.) be permitted.

34. TRENCH ZONE BACKFILL
    1. After the Pipe Zone material has been placed, compacted, approved by the Soil Technician and accepted by the City Engineer, backfill in the Trench Zone may proceed.
35. Compaction using vibratory equipment, tamping rollers, pneumatic tire rollers, or other mechanical tampers shall be performed with the type and size of equipment necessary to accomplish the work. The backfill shall be placed in horizontal layers of such depths as are considered proper for the type of compacting equipment being used in relation to the backfill material being placed. Each layer shall be evenly spread, properly moistened, and compacted to the specified relative density. The Contractor shall repair or replace any pipe, fitting, manhole, or structure damaged by the installation operations as directed by the City Engineer.
36. PAVEMENT ZONE BACKFILL AND RESTORATION
    1. After the Trench Zone material has been placed, compacted, approved by the Soil Technician, and accepted by the City Engineer; backfill in the Pavement Zone may proceed as necessary in accordance with the requirements of the agency having jurisdiction.
37. Replace bituminous and concrete pavement, curbs, and sidewalks removed or damaged during construction in accordance with the requirements of the agency having jurisdiction.
