   1. PRODUCTS
   1. MATERIALS
   1. Aggregate Base Course, where required or indicated in the plans and specifications, shall conform to CDOT Standard Specifications Section 703.03 for Class 6 Aggregate Base Course, except that asphaltic material will not be an allowed aggregate.
   1. Well Graded Pit Run, where required or indicated in the plans and specifications, shall conform to CDOT Standard Specifications Section 703.03 for Class 3 Aggregate Base Course.
   1. EXECUTION

General
   1. Placing. If the required compacted depth of the aggregate base course exceeds 6 inches, it shall be constructed in two or more layers of approximately equal thickness. The maximum compacted thickness of any one layer shall not exceed 6 inches. When vibratory or other approved types of special compacting equipment are used, the compacted depth of a single layer may be increased to 8 inches upon request, provided that specified density is achieved and written approval is given.
   1. Mixing. The Contractor shall mix the aggregate by methods that insure a thorough and homogenous mixture.
   1. Shaping and Compaction. Compaction of each layer shall continue until a density of not less than 95 percent of the maximum density determined in accordance with AASHTO T 180 has been achieved. The surface of each layer shall be maintained during the compaction operations so that a uniform texture is produced and the aggregates are firmly keyed. Water shall be uniformly applied during compaction in the quantity necessary for proper consolidation. The surface of the base course will be tested with a 10 foot straightedge, or other approved device. The surface shall be tested prior to the application of any primer or pavement. The variation of the surface from the testing edge of the straightedge between any two contacts with the surface shall not exceed Â¼ inch. All irregularities exceeding the specified tolerance shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the Testing Engineer and/or Project Engineer at no additional cost to the Owner. The above compaction and straightedge requirements shall not apply to shoulder gravel. Compaction of shoulder gravel shall be accomplished by wheel rolling, as directed.
   1. Proof Roll
   1. Prior to paving any street designated to be accepted as a public City street, the Contractor shall conduct a proof roll witnessed by the Testing Engineer, Project Engineer and City Engineer. Prior to proof roll, Testing Engineer shall submit test results to City Engineer for review and approval.
   1. The proof roll may be conducted after the required compaction has been obtained and the subgrade has been shaped to the required cross-section.
   1. Proof roll on road sub grade will be conducted with a loaded tandem axle pneumatic tire dump truck with 15 tons loaded on truck unless other equal or greater weight or different type of truck is approved by the Testing Engineer and/or Project Engineer and City Engineer. The loaded truck shall be driven over the area to be tested at a speed, pattern, and number of cycles to be determined by the City Engineer
   1. No loose material allowed on top of subgrade. Subgrade shall be packed and smooth on top with optimum moisture content.
   1. Sub grade shall not have any deflection in surfaces for proof roll to pass.
   1. Temperature must be above 32 degrees for a minimum of 48 hours before any proof roll on road sub grade is conducted.
   1. The proof roller shall be operated in a systematic manner so that a record may be readily kept of the area tested and the working time required for the testing.
   1. Areas that are observed to have soft spots in the subgrade, where deflection is not uniform or is excessive as determined by the Testing Engineer and/or Project Engineer, shall be ripped, scarified, dried or wetted as necessary and recompacted to the requirements for density and moisture at the Contractor's expense. After recompaction, these areas shall be proof rolled again and any failures again corrected at the Contractor's expense.
