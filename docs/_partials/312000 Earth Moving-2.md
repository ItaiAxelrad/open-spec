Carry the backfill up to the surface of the adjacent ground, and neatly grade its top to slope away from building or structure for proper drainage.
   1. Do not operate power-operated earth moving equipment closer to foundation walls than a distance equal to the height of backfill above the top of footing to the ground surface.
   1. Temporary Suspension of Work
   1. If Work is suspended more than 24 hours on a section receiving fill, the Testing Agency may direct that the area be graded and compacted to prevent loss of moisture and to facilitate drainage. Before Work is resumed, scarify, water or allow to dry as required, and recompact the surface.
   1. If compaction is performed in the fall or early winter, and operations stopped during the winter, roll the surface with a flatwheel roller, recompact the surface, and slope it to allow run-off of surface water. Permit no equipment on the surface after the completion of the above operations until it is dry enough to prevent rutting and remolding of the surface.

   1. Undercut and replace with properly placed granular materials, or moisture condition and recompact to specified unit weight, all areas that fail proof rolling test. Testing Agency will determine the depth of undercutting and/or moisture conditioning and recompacting.
   1. Unsuitable Material
   1. If unsuitable bearing or subgrade materials are encountered at surface elevation, the Testing Agency will determine appropriate depth of removal of unsuitable materials or other methods to achieve the desired results with notification to the Architect and Owner.
   1. If removal of unsuitable material is recommended by the Testing Agency, excavate and remove unsuitable material and replace with the specified material. Removal and replacement of material will be paid in accordance with established unit prices.
