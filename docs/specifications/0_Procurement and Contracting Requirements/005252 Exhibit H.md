   1. Arbitration. If the parties mutually agree, and the amount in controversy is less than $200,000 the Disputes between Owner and Engineer shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the  [*here insert the name of a specified arbitration service or organization*] rules effective at the Effective Date of the Agreement, subject to the conditions stated below. This agreement to arbitrate and any other agreement or consent to arbitrate entered into in accordance with this paragraph H.6.08.A will be specifically enforceable under prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction.

		1. Notice of the demand for arbitration must be filed in writing with the other party to the Agreement and with the  [*specified arbitration service or organization*]. The demand must be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen. In no event may the demand for arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such Dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
			2. All demands for arbitration and all answering statements thereto which include any monetary claims must contain a statement that the total sum or value in controversy as alleged by the party making such demand or answering statement is not more than $ (exclusive of interest and costs). The arbitrators will not have jurisdiction, power, or authority to consider, or make findings (except in denial of their own jurisdiction) concerning any Dispute if the amount in controversy in such Dispute is more than $ (exclusive of interest and costs), or to render a monetary award in response thereto against any party which totals more than $ (exclusive of interest and costs).

			4. The award rendered by the arbitrators will be consistent with the Agreement of the parties and final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and will not be subject to appeal or modification.
			5.

Nothing in this paragraph H.6.08.A.5 nor in the provision of such contract consenting to joinder shall create any claim, right, or cause of action in favor of the Joinable Party and against Owner or Engineer that does not otherwise exist.
