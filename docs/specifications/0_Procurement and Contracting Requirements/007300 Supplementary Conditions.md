1. These Supplementary Conditions amend or supplement the Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, EJCDC C-700 (2007 Edition). All provisions which are not so amended or supplemented remain in full force and effect.
2. The terms used in these Supplementary Conditions have the meanings stated in the General Conditions. Additional terms used in these Supplementary Conditions have the meanings stated below, which are applicable to both the singular and plural thereof.
3. The address system used in these Supplementary Conditions is the same as the address system used in the General Conditions, with the prefix "SC" added thereto.
4.  Copies of Documents 
   1. As electronic documents become more widely used, electronic copies of the Drawings, Specifications, and other Contract Documents are often made available in place of multiple sets of hard copy. If electronic documents are to be made available, the following may be used:

   1. GC-5.06.B states that Owner will purchase "equipment breakdown" insurance (formerly referred to as "boiler and machinery" insurance) or other additional property insurance if required to do so by the Supplementary Conditions or Laws and Regulations. If there is a specific requirement that Owner purchase any such property insurance, include the following, selecting Owner as the purchaser. In the alternative, the Contract could require that Contractor purchase equipment breakdown or other additional property insurance, in which case the following may be used for that purpose, by selecting Contractor as purchaser:
         1. SC-5.06 Delete Paragraph 5.06.B and replace with the following:
               1. [Owner] [Contractor]** *[select one, delete the other]* **shall purchase and maintain** *[here identify any specifically required equipment breakdown insurance or additional property insurance to be provided]***, and any other additional property insurance required by Laws and Regulations, which insurance will include the interest of Owner, Contractor, Subcontractors, and Engineer, and** *[here identify any other individuals or entities to be included as loss payees]* **and the officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, consultants and subcontractors of each and any of them, each of whom is deemed to have an insurable interest and shall be listed as a loss payee.

1. Owner’s exemption does not apply to construction tools, machinery, equipment, or other property purchased by or leased by Contractor, or to supplies or materials not incorporated into the Work.
   1. SC-6.13 *Safety and Protection*
   1. Some Owners have written safety programs with which construction contractors must comply. If such is the case, GC-6.13.C mandates that the safety program be identified in the Supplementary Conditions, which may be accomplished as follows:
         1. SC-6.13 Delete the second sentence of Paragraph 6.13.C and insert the following:
            1. The following Owner safety programs are applicable to the Work:** *[here expressly identify by title and/or date, any such Owner safety programs]*
   1. SC-6.17 *Shop Drawings and Samples   1. Reviews of multiple resubmissions of Shop Drawings and other submittals may increase Project costs. To mitigate this, the following language may be used:
      1. SC-6.17 Add the following new paragraphs immediately after Paragraph 6.17.E:
      	1. Contractor shall furnish required submittals with sufficient information and accuracy in order to obtain required approval of an item with no more than three submittals. Engineer will record Engineer’s time for reviewing subsequent submittals of Shop Drawings, samples, or other items requiring approval and Contractor shall reimburse Owner for Engineer’s charges for such time.
1. In the event that Contractor requests a change of a previously approved item, Contractor shall reimburse Owner for Engineer’s charges for its review time unless the need for such change is beyond the control of Contractor.
   1. SC-7.02 *Coordination*
   1. GC-7.02 requires that if in addition to retaining Contractor, Owner will contract with others to perform work at the Site, Owner must provide to Contractor specified information. Use the following in that case:

      1. SC-7.04 Add the following new paragraph immediately after paragraph GC-7.03:
    1. SC-7.04 *Claims Between Contractors*
   1. Should Contractor cause damage to the work or property of any other contractor at the Site, or should any claim arising out of Contractor’s performance of the Work at the Site be made by any other contractor against Contractor, Owner, Engineer, or the construction coordinator, then Contractor (without involving Owner, Engineer, or construction coordinator) shall either (1) remedy the damage, (2) agree to compensate the other contractor for remedy of the damage, or (3) remedy the damage and attempt to settle with such other contractor by agreement, or otherwise resolve the dispute by arbitration or at law.
   1. Contractor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and Regulations, indemnify and hold harmless Owner, Engineer, the construction coordinator and the officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and other consultants and subcontractors of each and any of them from and against all claims, costs, losses and damages (including, but not limited to, fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and court and arbitration costs) arising directly, indirectly or consequentially out of any action, legal or equitable, brought by any other contractor against Owner, Engineer, consultants, or the construction coordinator to the extent said claim is based on or arises out of Contractor’s performance of the Work. Should another contractor cause damage to the Work or property of Contractor or should the performance of work by any other contractor at the Site give rise to any other Claim, Contractor shall not institute any action, legal or equitable, against Owner, Engineer, or the construction coordinator or permit any action against any of them to be maintained and continued in its name or for its benefit in any court or before any arbiter which seeks to impose liability on or to recover damages from Owner, Engineer, or the construction coordinator on account of any such damage or Claim.
   1. If Contractor is delayed at any time in performing or furnishing the Work by any act or neglect of another contractor, and Owner and Contractor are unable to agree as to the extent of any adjustment in Contract Times attributable thereto, Contractor may make a Claim for an extension of times in accordance with Article 12. An extension of the Contract Times shall be Contractor’s exclusive remedy with respect to Owner, Engineer, and construction coordinator for any delay, disruption, interference, or hindrance caused by any other contractor. This paragraph does not prevent recovery from Owner, Engineer, or construction coordinator for activities that are their respective responsibilities.
SC-8.11 *Evidence of Financial Arrangements   1. The following SC-8.11 is intended for use in contracts where Owner is a private entity. It is reasonable for Contractor to seek such information, particularly if Owner and Contractor do not have a continuing relationship.
   1. SC-8.11 Add the following new paragraph immediately after Paragraph 8.11.A:
	1. On request of Contractor prior to the execution of any Change Order involving a significant increase in the Contract Price, Owner shall furnish to Contractor reasonable evidence that adequate financial arrangements have been made by Owner to enable Owner to fulfill the increased financial obligations to be undertaken by Owner as a result of such Change Order.
   1. SC-9.03 *Project Representative*

   1. As indicated in GC-9.03, in those cases in which the Engineer will provide a Resident Project Representative (RPR) during construction, the authority and responsibilities of the RPR and any assistants must be specified in the Supplementary Conditions; thus this is a mandatory Supplementary Condition in such cases. The following suggested language which parallels the working of Exhibit D to EJCDC E-500, the Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Engineer for Professional Services, should be edited to indicate the RPR authority and responsibilities that apply to this project:
1. SC-9.03 Add the following new paragraphs immediately after Paragraph 9.03.A:
1. B. The Resident Project Representative (RPR) will be Engineer's employee or agent at the Site, will act as directed by and under the supervision of Engineer, and will confer with Engineer regarding RPR's actions. RPR's dealings in matters pertaining to the Work in general shall be with Engineer and Contractor. RPR's dealings with Subcontractors shall be through or with the full knowledge and approval of Contractor. The RPR shall:
1. *Schedules:*  Review the progress schedule, schedule of Shop Drawing and Sample submittals, and schedule of values prepared by Contractor and consult with Engineer concerning acceptability.
1. 2. *Conferences and Meetings:* Attend meetings with Contractor, such as preconstruction conferences, progress meetings, job conferences and other project-related meetings, and prepare and circulate copies of minutes thereof.

1. 7. *Review of Work and Rejection of Defective Work*:
      1. a. Conduct on-Site observations of Contractor’s work in progress to assist Engineer in determining if the Work is in general proceeding in accordance with the Contract Documents.
1. b. Report to Engineer whenever RPR believes that any part of Contractor’s work in progress will not produce a completed Project that conforms generally to the Contract Documents or will imperil the integrity of the design concept of the completed Project as a functioning whole as indicated in the Contract Documents, or has been damaged, or does not meet the requirements of any inspection, test or approval required to be made; and advise Engineer of that part of work in progress that RPR believes should be corrected or rejected or should be uncovered for observation, or requires special testing, inspection or approval.
1. 8. *Inspections, Tests, and System Startups:*
1. a. Verify that tests, equipment, and systems start-ups and operating and maintenance training are conducted in the presence of appropriate Owner’s personnel, and that Contractor maintains adequate records thereof.

1. 8. Authorize Owner to occupy the Project in whole or in part.
   1. SC-11.01 *Cost of the Work   1. Equipment rental charges, particularly with respect to Contractor-owned equipment, can sometimes lead to disagreements. To reduce the possibility of such disagreements, the following SC may be used. Note that it requires a published reference or method for determining the costs.
   1. SC-11.01.A.5.c Delete Paragraph 11.01.A.5.c in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
			1. *Construction Equipment and Machinery:*
1. 1) Rentals of all construction equipment and machinery, and the parts thereof in accordance with rental agreements approved by Owner with the advice of Engineer, and the costs of transportation, loading, unloading, assembly, dismantling, and removal thereof. All such costs shall be in accordance with the terms of said rental agreements. The rental of any such equipment, machinery, or parts shall cease when the use thereof is no longer necessary for the Work.
1. 2) Costs for equipment and machinery owned by Contractor will be paid at a rate shown for such equipment in the** [*cite the rate book appropriate for the Project*]**. An hourly rate will be computed by dividing the monthly rates by 176. These computed rates will include all operating costs. Costs will include the time the equipment or machinery is in use on the changed Work and the costs of transportation, loading, unloading, assembly, dismantling, and removal when directly attributable to the changed Work. The cost of any such equipment or machinery, or parts thereof, shall cease to accrue when the use thereof is no longer necessary for the changed Work. Equipment or machinery with a value of less than $1,000 will be considered small tools.
   1. SC-11.03 *Unit Price Work*
   1. The following SC is typically called a variation in estimated quantities clause and facilitates administrative resolution of situations where actual quantities differ materially from estimated quantities. Typically, the clause applies where the Bid price of an item of the Unit Price Work is more than 5 percent of the Contract Price and the actual quantity of the units of work performed varies by 15 to 25 percent. 
   1. SC-11.03.D Delete Paragraph 11.03.D in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
	1. The unit price of an item of Unit Price Work shall be subject to reevaluation and adjustment under the following conditions:
      1. if the Bid price of a particular item of Unit Price Work amounts to**  **percent or more of the Contract Price and the variation in the quantity of that particular item of Unit Price Work performed by Contractor differs by more than**  **percent from the estimated quantity of such item indicated in the Agreement; and
1. if there is no corresponding adjustment with respect to any other item of Work; and
1. if Contractor believes that Contractor has incurred additional expense as a result thereof or if Owner believes that the quantity variation entitles Owner to an adjustment in the unit price, either Owner or Contractor may make a Claim for an adjustment in the Contract Price in accordance with Article 10 if the parties are unable to agree as to the effect of any such variations in the quantit****y of Unit Price Work performed.
   1. SC-12.01 *Change of Contract Price*

   1. In some cases a change in Contract Price will include a Contractor's fee for overhead and profit, which under GC-12.01.C.2 may be determined through application of prescribed percentages on portions of the Cost of the Work. The percentages to be applied to subcontract work of one or more tiers is set forth in GC-12.01.C.2.c, under which the Subcontractor actually performing the work earns a fee of 15 percent, and any higher tier Subcontractors and the Contractor will each earn a fee of 5 percent of the amount paid to the next lower tier Subcontractor. If the parties wish to cap the total amount of the fee that could result from application of this formula, EJCDC suggests the following Supplementary Condition establishing a maximum fee of 27 percent, based on a fee at three tiers (1.15 x 1.05 x 1.05=1.268):
1. SC-12.01.C *Contractor's Fee.* Delete the semicolon at the end of GC 12.01.C.2.c, and add the following language:*

 **, provided, however, that on any subcontracted work the total maximum fee to be paid by Owner under this subparagraph shall be no greater than 27 percent of the costs incurred by the Subcontractor who actually performs the work;
   1. SC-16.01 *Methods and Procedure*
   1. As an alternative to the dispute resolution process set forth in the General Conditions (mediation followed by litigation), the contract could pair final and binding arbitration with mediation. A discussion of the pros and cons of the arbitration process (and there are many advocates on either side) is beyond the scope of this Guide. Consultation with the Owner’s legal counsel is highly recommended. Users should also note that they will need to insert the name of an arbitration agency, such as the American Arbitration Association or the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution, in SC-16.02.A. The mediation/arbitration option requires the following:
         1. SC-16.01 Delete Paragraph 16.01.C in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
               1. If the Claim is not resolved by mediation, Engineer’s action under Paragraph 10.05.C or a denial pursuant to Paragraphs 10.05.C.3 or 10.05.D shall become final and binding 30 days after termination of the mediation unless, within that time period, Owner or Contractor:
