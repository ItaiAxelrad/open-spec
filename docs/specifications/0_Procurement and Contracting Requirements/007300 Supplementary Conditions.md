		1. *Mandatory Supplementary Conditions*
   1. Several provisions of the General Conditions expressly indicate that essential project-specific information will be set out in a corresponding Supplementary Condition. For example, GC-5.04.B indicates that required insurance coverage limits will be specified in the Supplementary Conditions. Every EJCDC-based construction contract should include, at a minimum, the following Supplementary Conditions:
         1. One of two suggested SC-4.02s, concerning reports and drawings of conditions at the Site, and any "technical data" in the reports and drawings on which the Contractor may rely;
2. one of two suggested SC-4.06s, concerning reports and drawings regarding Hazardous Environmental Conditions at the Site, and any "technical data" in those reports and drawings on which the Contractor may rely; and
3. SC-5.04, identifying specific insurance coverage requirements.
   1. Other suggested Supplementary Conditions are mandatory under specific circumstances:
      1. for example, on projects in which the Engineer is providing the services of a Resident Project Representative (RPR), SC-9.03, concerning the authority and responsibilities of the RPR, would be mandatory; and on projects in which the Contractor will be responsible for compliance with Owner's safety program, SC-6.13 would be mandatory.

		1. *Relationship of Supplementary Conditions to Other Contract Documents*
   1. Supplementary Conditions are modifications to the General Conditions—additions, deletions, changes. This is as the term is defined by EJCDC and the Construction Specification Institute (CSI). Other organizations use their supplementary conditions to modify a broader range of contract documents, such as agreement forms and standard specifications. 
   1. This Guide and the other Construction-related documents prepared and issued by EJCDC assume use of the 1995 CSI MasterFormat™ concept, which provides an organizational format for location of all bound documentary information for a construction project:
      1. Bidding Requirements, contract forms (Agreement, Bonds, and certificates), General Conditions, Supplementary Conditions, and Specifications. Under the 1995 CSI MasterFormat™, the last grouping, Specifications, is divided into 16 Divisions, the first of which, Division 1, is entitled “General Requirements.” (CSI issued a radically different form of MasterFormat™ in 2004. It is described in CSI’s Project Resource Manual. EJCDC is expected to consider MasterFormat 2004 during the next revision cycle for the construction documents.)
   1. The standard fundamental provisions affecting the rights and duties of the parties appear in the General Conditions. Language to modify the fundamental relationships between the parties, supplement the framework set forth in the General Conditions, or change the language of the General Conditions, should appear in the Supplementary Conditions. Examples of this are a change in the payment provisions and supplemental language specifying the details of insurance coverages and limits for the Project.
   1. Price terms, monetary terms such as liquidated damages clauses, and completion dates should all be set forth in the Agreement (EJCDC C-520 or C-525), and should not be included in the Supplementary Conditions.
   1. The substance of the General Requirements (Division 1 of the Specifications) falls generally into three categories:
      1. (1) administrative requirements, such as summary of work, allowances, coordination, alternatives (materials, equipment, or price), product options, project meetings, and project close-out; (2) work-related provisions, such as temporary facilities, field testing, and start-up; and (3) general provisions applicable to more than one section in Divisions 2 through 16.

		1. *Arrangement of Subject Matter*
   1. This Guide is arranged in the same order as the paragraphs in the 2007 edition of the General Conditions, and the paragraphs herein bear comparable addresses to those of the General Conditions but with the prefix “SC.” A discussion of the purpose and function of these suggested Supplementary Conditions is included in EJCDC C-001, Narrative Guide. 

		1. *Use of this Guide*
   1. The text presented in bold type in the remainder of this Guide is suggested language for some commonly used Supplementary Conditions. The drafter should bear in mind that most contractual provisions have important legal consequences. Consultation with legal counsel before finalization of any amendment or supplement is recommended.
   1. Many sets of supplementary conditions examined by EJCDC contain typical or “boilerplate” provisions that have accumulated like moss over the years, appear to have no practical significance for the particular project, and may produce unintended and surprising legal consequences. Such provisions are usually there because someone saw similar terms in other contract documents and it “sounded good.” Selecting contract terms in that manner is not recommended. Provisions of the Supplementary Conditions should address a particular point in the General Conditions or cover a particular topic. The Supplementary Conditions should not be a repository for general language of vague meaning for which another location cannot be readily found.
   1. This Guide assumes a general familiarity with the other Contract Documents prepared by EJCDC and, when drafting language, specific attention to them is encouraged. Standard documents or prescribed forms issued by governmental bodies and other owners may differ materially from the documents of EJCDC so that careful correlation of any amending or supplementing language is essential. The loose practice of stating that any provision in one document that is inconsistent with another is superseded, or that one document always takes precedence over another in the event of a conflict in language or requirements, is discouraged. The resulting legal consequences of such provisions are frequently difficult to decipher and may be very different from what was anticipated.
   1. The General Conditions use carefully chosen language and set forth the basic responsibilities of the parties with respect to fundamental matters and legal consequences. Their provisions should be altered only where mandated by the specific requirements of a given project and the consequences of any modification are thoroughly understood.
   1. Caution should be exercised when making any change in the standard documents. They have been carefully prepared, terms are used uniformly throughout and are consistent with the terms in other EJCDC documents. Their provisions have been carefully integrated, and are dependent on one another. A change in one document may necessitate a change in another, and a change in one paragraph may necessitate a change in other language of the same document. No change should be made until its full effect on the rest of the General Conditions and other Contract Documents has been considered.
   1. Lastly, remember that an engineer is neither qualified nor licensed to give advice to others on the legal consequences of contracts. All of the Contract Documents have important legal consequences. Owners should be encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before accepting any modification of the printed forms, before the documents are sent out for bidding, and most assuredly before signing any agreement.

	1. Standard Prefatory Language And Traditional Format For Supplementary Conditions
   1. Suggested format and wording conventions for Supplementary Conditions appear below.

		1. *Table of Contents*
   1. The inclusion of a table of contents will benefit the user of the Supplementary Conditions, especially if additional articles (beyond the 17 Articles of the General Conditions) are added for the purpose of including mandated or other provisions.

		1. *Pagination*
   1. The CSI MasterFormat™, October 1995, assigns Document Number 00800 to Supplementary Conditions. Unless another format is chosen, pages should be numbered 00800-1, 00800-2, 00800-n. If CSI’s MasterFormat 04™ is being used for the Project Manual, consult MasterFormat 04 for the appropriate section number and number the pages accordingly.

		1. *Format for Complete Paragraph Change*
   1. When completely superseding a paragraph of the General Conditions, the following language may be used:
      1. SC-5.09.B Delete Paragraph 5.09.B in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
    1. 


		1. *Format for Change within a Paragraph*
   1. When changing language within a paragraph of the General Conditions, the following language may be used:
      1. SC-6.21.A Amend the second sentence of Paragraph 6.21.A (to read as follows) *[or]* (by striking out the following words):
    1. 



		1. *Format for Additional Language*
   1. When adding language to an existing paragraph of the General Conditions, the idea may be expressed as follows:
      1. SC-9.03 Add the following language at the end of the second sentence of Paragraph 9.03:
    1. 



		1. *Format for Additional Paragraph*
   1. If it is desired to add a new paragraph to the General Conditions, the thought may be expressed as follows:
      1. SC-8.06 Add the following new paragraph immediately after Paragraph 8.06.B:
    1. 



	1. Alternate Format For Supplementary Conditions
   1. Electronic files are commonly used for transmittal and storage of the text of standard documents. In fact, EJCDC no longer prepares printed documents. Because it is easy to modify documents electronically, it is increasingly common for practitioners to integrate the text of desired Supplementary Conditions into the text of the General Conditions. Most word processing programs have line-out and underlining features which accurately show deletions, changes, and additions. Users of EJCDC’s General Conditions are contractually obligated, through the terms of the purchase of the document, to clearly delineate all changes made to the standard text. It would be misleading to users to imply or represent that the General Conditions are EJCDC's General Conditions if changes are not properly and clearly identified.
   1. SUGGESTED SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS 

*Caption and Introductory Statements*
   1. The following is a suggestion for use at the beginning of the Supplementary Conditions:
         1. Supplementary Conditions
1. These Supplementary Conditions amend or supplement the Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, EJCDC C-700 (2007 Edition). All provisions which are not so amended or supplemented remain in full force and effect.
1. The terms used in these Supplementary Conditions have the meanings stated in the General Conditions. Additional terms used in these Supplementary Conditions have the meanings stated below, which are applicable to both the singular and plural thereof.
1. The address system used in these Supplementary Conditions is the same as the address system used in the General Conditions, with the prefix "SC" added thereto.
02. *Copies of Documents   1. As electronic documents become more widely used, electronic copies of the Drawings, Specifications, and other Contract Documents are often made available in place of multiple sets of hard copy. If electronic documents are to be made available, the following may be used:
      1. SC-2.02 Delete Paragraph 2.02.A in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
         1. Owner shall furnish to Contractor up to**  **printed or hard copies of the Drawings and Project Manual and one set in electronic format. Additional copies will be furnished upon request at the cost of reproduction.
02. *Subsurface and Physical Conditions*
1. This is a mandatory Supplementary Condition.** GC-4.02 requires the identification of all known documents regarding subsurface and physical conditions at the Site. Use the first version of SC-4.02, presented immediately below, for the purpose of identifying the known Site condition documents. If no such documents are known, then use the second version of SC-4.02, below.
   1. SC-4.02 Add the following new paragraphs immediately after Paragraph 4.02.B:
	1. The following reports of explorations and tests of subsurface conditions at or contiguous to the Site are known to Owner:

*[Use one of the following two subparagraphs:]*
1. a. All of the information in such drawings constitutes “technical data” on which Contractor may rely, except for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ appearing on Drawing No. \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ appearing on Drawing No. \_\_\_\_\_\_.

*[or]*
1. a. None of the contents of such drawings is "technical data" on which Contractor may rely.
   1. The reports and drawings identified above are not part of the Contract Documents, but the “technical data” contained therein upon which Contractor may rely, as expressly identified and established above, are incorporated in the Contract Documents by reference. Contractor is not entitled to rely upon any other information and data known to or identified by Owner or Engineer.
2. Copies of reports and drawings identified in SC-4.02.C and SC-4.02.D that are not included with the Bidding Documents may be examined at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** *[insert location]* **during regular business hours.
   1. If there are no known Site-related reports or drawings, use the following version of SC-4.02:

      	1. No reports of explorations or tests of subsurface conditions at or contiguous to the Site, or drawings of physical conditions relating to existing surface or subsurface structures at the Site, are known to Owner.
   1. SC-4.06 *Hazardous Environmental Conditions*
1. This is a mandatory Supplementary Condition.** GC-4.06 contemplates the identification of all known documents regarding Hazardous Environmental Conditions (HEC) that have been identified at the Site. Use the first version of SC-4.06, presented immediately below, to identify the known HEC documents. If no HEC documents are known, then use the second version of SC-4.06, below.
1. SC-4.06 Add the following subparagraphs 4.06.A.1 and 4.06.A.2:
      1. The following reports regarding Hazardous Environmental Conditions at the Site are known to Owner:

      1. SC-5.06.A. Delete Paragraph 5.06.A in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
         1. A. Contractor shall purchase and maintain property insurance upon the Work at the Site in the amount of the full replacement cost thereof. Contractor shall be responsible for any deductible or self-insured retention. This insurance shall:
               1. include the interests of Owner, Contractor, Subcontractors, Engineer, and** *[here identify by name (not genre) any other individuals or entities to be listed as loss payees]* **and the officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and other consultants and subcontractors of any of them, each of whom is deemed to have an insurable interest and shall be listed as an insured or loss payee;

		1. be written on a Builder’s Risk “all-risk” policy form that shall at least include insurance for physical loss and damage to the Work, temporary buildings, falsework, and materials and equipment in transit and shall insure against at least the following perils or causes of loss: fire, lightning, extended coverage, theft, vandalism and malicious mischief, earthquake, collapse, debris removal, demolition occasioned by enforcement of Laws and Regulations, water damage (other than that caused by flood), and such other perils or causes of loss as may be specifically required by these Supplementary Conditions.
1. include expenses incurred in the repair or replacement of any insured property (including but not limited to fees and charges of engineers and architects);

   1. GC-5.06.B states that Owner will purchase "equipment breakdown" insurance (formerly referred to as "boiler and machinery" insurance) or other additional property insurance if required to do so by the Supplementary Conditions or Laws and Regulations. If there is a specific requirement that Owner purchase any such property insurance, include the following, selecting Owner as the purchaser. In the alternative, the Contract could require that Contractor purchase equipment breakdown or other additional property insurance, in which case the following may be used for that purpose, by selecting Contractor as purchaser:
         1. SC-5.06 Delete Paragraph 5.06.B and replace with the following:
               1. [Owner] [Contractor]** *[select one, delete the other]* **shall purchase and maintain** *[here identify any specifically required equipment breakdown insurance or additional property insurance to be provided]***, and any other additional property insurance required by Laws and Regulations, which insurance will include the interest of Owner, Contractor, Subcontractors, and Engineer, and** *[here identify any other individuals or entities to be included as loss payees]* **and the officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, consultants and subcontractors of each and any of them, each of whom is deemed to have an insurable interest and shall be listed as a loss payee.

1. Owner will furnish the required certificates of tax exemption to Contractor for use in the purchase of supplies and materials to be incorporated into the Work.
1. Owner’s exemption does not apply to construction tools, machinery, equipment, or other property purchased by or leased by Contractor, or to supplies or materials not incorporated into the Work.
   1. SC-6.13 *Safety and Protection*
   1. Some Owners have written safety programs with which construction contractors must comply. If such is the case, GC-6.13.C mandates that the safety program be identified in the Supplementary Conditions, which may be accomplished as follows:
         1. SC-6.13 Delete the second sentence of Paragraph 6.13.C and insert the following:
            1. The following Owner safety programs are applicable to the Work:** *[here expressly identify by title and/or date, any such Owner safety programs]*
   1. SC-6.17 *Shop Drawings and Samples   1. Reviews of multiple resubmissions of Shop Drawings and other submittals may increase Project costs. To mitigate this, the following language may be used:
      1. SC-6.17 Add the following new paragraphs immediately after Paragraph 6.17.E:
      	1. Contractor shall furnish required submittals with sufficient information and accuracy in order to obtain required approval of an item with no more than three submittals. Engineer will record Engineer’s time for reviewing subsequent submittals of Shop Drawings, samples, or other items requiring approval and Contractor shall reimburse Owner for Engineer’s charges for such time.
1. In the event that Contractor requests a change of a previously approved item, Contractor shall reimburse Owner for Engineer’s charges for its review time unless the need for such change is beyond the control of Contractor.
   1. SC-7.02 *Coordination*
   1. GC-7.02 requires that if in addition to retaining Contractor, Owner will contract with others to perform work at the Site, Owner must provide to Contractor specified information. Use the following in that case:
         1. SC-7.02 Delete Paragraph 7.02.A in its entirety and replace with the following:
            1. A. Owner intends to contract with others for the performance of other work on the Project at the Site.

1. 3. The extent of such authority and responsibilities is:** *[here provide the extent]*
   1. SC-7.04 *Claims Between Contractors*
   1. On projects involving multiple contractors, use the following:
      1. SC-7.04 Add the following new paragraph immediately after paragraph GC-7.03:
    1. SC-7.04 *Claims Between Contractors*
   1. Should Contractor cause damage to the work or property of any other contractor at the Site, or should any claim arising out of Contractor’s performance of the Work at the Site be made by any other contractor against Contractor, Owner, Engineer, or the construction coordinator, then Contractor (without involving Owner, Engineer, or construction coordinator) shall either (1) remedy the damage, (2) agree to compensate the other contractor for remedy of the damage, or (3) remedy the damage and attempt to settle with such other contractor by agreement, or otherwise resolve the dispute by arbitration or at law.
   1. Contractor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and Regulations, indemnify and hold harmless Owner, Engineer, the construction coordinator and the officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and other consultants and subcontractors of each and any of them from and against all claims, costs, losses and damages (including, but not limited to, fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys, and other professionals and court and arbitration costs) arising directly, indirectly or consequentially out of any action, legal or equitable, brought by any other contractor against Owner, Engineer, consultants, or the construction coordinator to the extent said claim is based on or arises out of Contractor’s performance of the Work. Should another contractor cause damage to the Work or property of Contractor or should the performance of work by any other contractor at the Site give rise to any other Claim, Contractor shall not institute any action, legal or equitable, against Owner, Engineer, or the construction coordinator or permit any action against any of them to be maintained and continued in its name or for its benefit in any court or before any arbiter which seeks to impose liability on or to recover damages from Owner, Engineer, or the construction coordinator on account of any such damage or Claim.
   1. If Contractor is delayed at any time in performing or furnishing the Work by any act or neglect of another contractor, and Owner and Contractor are unable to agree as to the extent of any adjustment in Contract Times attributable thereto, Contractor may make a Claim for an extension of times in accordance with Article 12. An extension of the Contract Times shall be Contractor’s exclusive remedy with respect to Owner, Engineer, and construction coordinator for any delay, disruption, interference, or hindrance caused by any other contractor. This paragraph does not prevent recovery from Owner, Engineer, or construction coordinator for activities that are their respective responsibilities.
SC-8.11 *Evidence of Financial Arrangements   1. The following SC-8.11 is intended for use in contracts where Owner is a private entity. It is reasonable for Contractor to seek such information, particularly if Owner and Contractor do not have a continuing relationship.
   1. SC-8.11 Add the following new paragraph immediately after Paragraph 8.11.A:
	1. On request of Contractor prior to the execution of any Change Order involving a significant increase in the Contract Price, Owner shall furnish to Contractor reasonable evidence that adequate financial arrangements have been made by Owner to enable Owner to fulfill the increased financial obligations to be undertaken by Owner as a result of such Change Order.
   1. SC-9.03 *Project Representative*

   1. As indicated in GC-9.03, in those cases in which the Engineer will provide a Resident Project Representative (RPR) during construction, the authority and responsibilities of the RPR and any assistants must be specified in the Supplementary Conditions; thus this is a mandatory Supplementary Condition in such cases. The following suggested language which parallels the working of Exhibit D to EJCDC E-500, the Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Engineer for Professional Services, should be edited to indicate the RPR authority and responsibilities that apply to this project:
    1. 
1. SC-9.03 Add the following new paragraphs immediately after Paragraph 9.03.A:
    1. 
1. B. The Resident Project Representative (RPR) will be Engineer's employee or agent at the Site, will act as directed by and under the supervision of Engineer, and will confer with Engineer regarding RPR's actions. RPR's dealings in matters pertaining to the Work in general shall be with Engineer and Contractor. RPR's dealings with Subcontractors shall be through or with the full knowledge and approval of Contractor. The RPR shall:
    1. 
1. *Schedules:*  Review the progress schedule, schedule of Shop Drawing and Sample submittals, and schedule of values prepared by Contractor and consult with Engineer concerning acceptability.

1. b. Report to Engineer whenever RPR believes that any part of Contractor’s work in progress will not produce a completed Project that conforms generally to the Contract Documents or will imperil the integrity of the design concept of the completed Project as a functioning whole as indicated in the Contract Documents, or has been damaged, or does not meet the requirements of any inspection, test or approval required to be made; and advise Engineer of that part of work in progress that RPR believes should be corrected or rejected or should be uncovered for observation, or requires special testing, inspection or approval.
1. 8. *Inspections, Tests, and System Startups:*
1. a. Verify that tests, equipment, and systems start-ups and operating and maintenance training are conducted in the presence of appropriate Owner’s personnel, and that Contractor maintains adequate records thereof.

1. 8. Authorize Owner to occupy the Project in whole or in part.
   1. SC-11.01 *Cost of the Work   1. Equipment rental charges, particularly with respect to Contractor-owned equipment, can sometimes lead to disagreements. To reduce the possibility of such disagreements, the following SC may be used. Note that it requires a published reference or method for determining the costs.
   1. SC-11.01.A.5.c Delete Paragraph 11.01.A.5.c in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
			1. *Construction Equipment and Machinery:*
1. 1) Rentals of all construction equipment and machinery, and the parts thereof in accordance with rental agreements approved by Owner with the advice of Engineer, and the costs of transportation, loading, unloading, assembly, dismantling, and removal thereof. All such costs shall be in accordance with the terms of said rental agreements. The rental of any such equipment, machinery, or parts shall cease when the use thereof is no longer necessary for the Work.
1. 2) Costs for equipment and machinery owned by Contractor will be paid at a rate shown for such equipment in the** [*cite the rate book appropriate for the Project*]**. An hourly rate will be computed by dividing the monthly rates by 176. These computed rates will include all operating costs. Costs will include the time the equipment or machinery is in use on the changed Work and the costs of transportation, loading, unloading, assembly, dismantling, and removal when directly attributable to the changed Work. The cost of any such equipment or machinery, or parts thereof, shall cease to accrue when the use thereof is no longer necessary for the changed Work. Equipment or machinery with a value of less than $1,000 will be considered small tools.
   1. SC-11.03 *Unit Price Work*
   1. The following SC is typically called a variation in estimated quantities clause and facilitates administrative resolution of situations where actual quantities differ materially from estimated quantities. Typically, the clause applies where the Bid price of an item of the Unit Price Work is more than 5 percent of the Contract Price and the actual quantity of the units of work performed varies by 15 to 25 percent. 
   1. SC-11.03.D Delete Paragraph 11.03.D in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
	1. The unit price of an item of Unit Price Work shall be subject to reevaluation and adjustment under the following conditions:
      1. if the Bid price of a particular item of Unit Price Work amounts to**  **percent or more of the Contract Price and the variation in the quantity of that particular item of Unit Price Work performed by Contractor differs by more than**  **percent from the estimated quantity of such item indicated in the Agreement; and
1. if there is no corresponding adjustment with respect to any other item of Work; and
1. if Contractor believes that Contractor has incurred additional expense as a result thereof or if Owner believes that the quantity variation entitles Owner to an adjustment in the unit price, either Owner or Contractor may make a Claim for an adjustment in the Contract Price in accordance with Article 10 if the parties are unable to agree as to the effect of any such variations in the quantit****y of Unit Price Work performed.
   1. SC-12.01 *Change of Contract Price*

   1. In some cases a change in Contract Price will include a Contractor's fee for overhead and profit, which under GC-12.01.C.2 may be determined through application of prescribed percentages on portions of the Cost of the Work. The percentages to be applied to subcontract work of one or more tiers is set forth in GC-12.01.C.2.c, under which the Subcontractor actually performing the work earns a fee of 15 percent, and any higher tier Subcontractors and the Contractor will each earn a fee of 5 percent of the amount paid to the next lower tier Subcontractor. If the parties wish to cap the total amount of the fee that could result from application of this formula, EJCDC suggests the following Supplementary Condition establishing a maximum fee of 27 percent, based on a fee at three tiers (1.15 x 1.05 x 1.05=1.268):
    1. 
1. SC-12.01.C *Contractor's Fee.* Delete the semicolon at the end of GC 12.01.C.2.c, and add the following language:*

 **, provided, however, that on any subcontracted work the total maximum fee to be paid by Owner under this subparagraph shall be no greater than 27 percent of the costs incurred by the Subcontractor who actually performs the work;
   1. SC-16.01 *Methods and Procedure*
   1. As an alternative to the dispute resolution process set forth in the General Conditions (mediation followed by litigation), the contract could pair final and binding arbitration with mediation. A discussion of the pros and cons of the arbitration process (and there are many advocates on either side) is beyond the scope of this Guide. Consultation with the Owner’s legal counsel is highly recommended. Users should also note that they will need to insert the name of an arbitration agency, such as the American Arbitration Association or the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution, in SC-16.02.A. The mediation/arbitration option requires the following:
         1. SC-16.01 Delete Paragraph 16.01.C in its entirety and insert the following in its place:
               1. If the Claim is not resolved by mediation, Engineer’s action under Paragraph 10.05.C or a denial pursuant to Paragraphs 10.05.C.3 or 10.05.D shall become final and binding 30 days after termination of the mediation unless, within that time period, Owner or Contractor:
2. elects in writing to demand arbitration of the Claim, pursuant to Paragraph SC-16.02; or
3. agrees with the other party to submit the Claim to another dispute resolution process.
1. SC-16.02 Add the following new paragraph immediately after Paragraph 16.01.

 **SC-16.02 *Arbitration*
   1. All Claims or counterclaims, disputes, or other matters in question between Owner and Contractor arising out of or relating to the Contract Documents or the breach thereof (except for Claims which have been waived by the making or acceptance of final payment as provided by Paragraph 14.09) including but not limited to those not resolved under the provisions of Paragraphs SC-16.01A and 16.01.B will be decided by arbitration in accordance with the rules of** *[insert name of selected arbitration agency]***, subject to the conditions and limitations of this Paragraph SC-16.02. This agreement to arbitrate and any other agreement or consent to arbitrate entered into will be specifically enforceable under the prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction.
2. The demand for arbitration will be filed in writing with the other party to the Contract and with the selected arbitrator or arbitration provider, and a copy will be sent to Engineer for information. The demand for arbitration will be made within the 30 day period specified in Paragraph SC-16.01.C, and in all other cases within a reasonable time after the Claim or counterclaim, dispute, or other matter in question has arisen, and in no event shall any such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such Claim or other dispute or matter in question would be barred by the applicable statue of limitations.
3. No arbitration arising out of or relating to the Contract Documents shall include by consolidation, joinder, or in any other manner any other individual or entity (including Engineer, and Engineer’s consultants and the officers, directors, partners, agents, employees or consultants of any of them) who is not a party to this Contract unless:
4. the inclusion of such other individual or entity is necessary if complete relief is to be afforded among those who are already parties to the arbitration; and
5. such other individual or entity is substantially involved in a question of law or fact which is common to those who are already parties to the arbitration and which will arise in such proceedings.
6. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be consistent with the agreement of the parties, in writing, and include:
      1. (i) a concise breakdown of the award; (ii) a written explanation of the award specifically citing the Contract Document provisions deemed applicable and relied on in making the award.
7. The award will be final. Judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and it will not be subject to modification or appeal, subject to provisions of the Controlling Law relating to vacating or modifying an arbitral award.
8. The fees and expenses of the arbitrators and any arbitration service shall be shared equally by Owner and Contractor.
