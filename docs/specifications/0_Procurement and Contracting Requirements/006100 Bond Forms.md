3. This obligation shall be null and void if:

2.. All Bids are rejected by Owner, or
3.. Owner fails to issue a Notice of Award to Bidder within the time specified in the Bidding Documents (or any extension thereof agreed to in writing by Bidder and, if applicable, consented to by Surety when required by Paragraph 5 hereof).

Payment under this Bond will be due and payable upon default by Bidder and within 30 calendar days after receipt by Bidder and Surety of written notice of default from Owner, which notice will be given with reasonable promptness, identifying this Bond and the Project and including a statement of the amount due.
5. Surety waives notice of any and all defenses based on or arising out of any time extension to issue Notice of Award agreed to in writing by Owner and Bidder, provided that the total time for issuing Notice of Award including extensions shall not in the aggregate exceed 120 days from Bid due date without Surety's written consent.
6. No suit or action shall be commenced under this Bond prior to 30 calendar days after the notice of default required in Paragraph 4 above is received by Bidder and Surety and in no case later than one year after Bid due date.
