			2. A bidding or negotiating contingency of  percent will be added to any Construction Cost limit established.
			3. The acceptance by Owner at any time during Basic Services of a revised opinion of probable Construction Cost in excess of the then established Construction Cost limit will constitute a corresponding increase in the Construction Cost limit.

In such cases, Owner shall consent to an adjustment in the Construction Cost limit commensurate with any applicable change in the general level of prices in the construction industry between the date of completion of the Final Design Phase and the date on which proposals or Bids are sought.
			6. If the lowest bona fide proposal or Bid exceeds the established Construction Cost limit, Owner shall (1) give written approval to increase such Construction Cost limit, or (2) authorize negotiating or rebidding the Project within a reasonable time, or (3) cooperate in revising the Project's scope, extent, or character to the extent consistent with the Project’s requirements and with sound engineering practices. In the case of (3), Engineer shall modify the Contract Documents as necessary to bring the Construction Cost within the Construction Cost Limit.
			7. All services of Engineer in respect of paragraph F.5.02.F shall be at the sole expense of Engineer. The providing of such services will be the limit of Engineer’s responsibility in this regard and, having done so, Engineer shall be entitled to payment for services and expenses in accordance with this Agreement and will not otherwise be liable for damages attributable to the lowest bona fide proposal or bid exceeding the established Construction Cost.
