   1. THIS IS AN AGREEMENT effective as of 

(“Effective Date”) between

(“Owner) and

(“Engineer”).
   1. Owner intends to 

(“Project”)
   1. Financial assistance for this Project is expected to be provided by

(“Agency),
   1. a governmental entity. Nothing herein creates any contractual relationship between Agency and Engineer.
   1. Owner and Engineer agree as follows
   1. Services of Engineer
   1. Scope
   1. Engineer shall provide, or cause to be provided, the services set forth herein and in Exhibit A.
   1. Owner’s Responsibilities

## General

   1. Owner shall have the responsibilities set forth herein and in Exhibit B.
   1. Owner shall pay Engineer as set forth in Exhibit C.
   1. Owner shall be responsible for, and Engineer may rely upon, the accuracy and completeness of all requirements, programs, instructions, reports, data, and other information furnished by Owner to Engineer pursuant to this Agreement. Engineer may use such requirements, programs, instructions, reports, data, and information in performing or furnishing services under this Agreement.
   1. Schedule For Rendering Services
   1. Commencement
   1. Engineer shall begin rendering services as of the Effective Date of the Agreement.
   1. Time for Completion
   1. Engineer shall complete its obligations within a reasonable time. Specific periods of time for rendering services are set forth or specific dates by which services are to be completed are provided in Exhibit A, and are hereby agreed to be reasonable.
   1. If, through no fault of Engineer, such periods of time or dates are changed, or the orderly and continuous progress of Engineer’s services is impaired, or Engineer’s services are delayed or suspended, then the time for completion of Engineer’s services, and the rates and amounts of Engineer’s compensation, shall be adjusted equitably.
   1. If Owner authorizes changes in the scope, extent, or character of the Project, then the time for completion of Engineer’s services, and the rates and amounts of Engineer’s compensation, shall be adjusted equitably.
   1. Owner shall make decisions and carry out its other responsibilities in a timely manner so as not to delay the Engineer’s performance of its services.
   1. If Engineer fails, through its own fault, to complete the performance required in this Agreement within the time set forth, as duly adjusted, then Owner shall be entitled to the recovery of direct damages resulting from such failure.
   1. Invoices and Payments
   1. Invoices

*Preparation and Submittal of Invoices.* Engineer shall prepare invoices in accordance with its standard invoicing practices and the terms of Exhibit C, and in a manner acceptable to Owner. Engineer shall submit its invoices to Owner no more than once per month. Invoices are due and payable within 60 days of receipt.
   1. Payments

*Application to Interest and Principal.* Payment will be credited first to any interest owed to Engineer and then to principal.

*Failure to Pay*. If Owner fails to make any payment due Engineer for services and expenses within 60 days after receipt of Engineer’s invoice and funds are available for the Project, then:
      1. amounts due Engineer will be increased at the rate of 1.0% per month (or the maximum rate of interest permitted by law, if less) from said sixtieth day; and
   1. Engineer may, after giving seven days written notice to Owner, suspend services under this Agreement until Owner has paid in full all amounts due for services, expenses, and other related charges. Owner waives any and all claims against Engineer for any such suspension.

*Disputed Invoices.* If Owner contests an invoice, Owner may withhold only that portion so contested, and must pay the undisputed portion.

*Legislative Actions.* If after the Effective Date of the Agreement any governmental entity takes a legislative action that imposes taxes, fees, or charges on Engineer’s services or compensation under this Agreement, then the Engineer may invoice such new taxes, fees, or charges as a Reimbursable Expense to which a factor of 1.0 shall be applied. Owner shall pay such invoiced new taxes, fees, and charges; such payment shall be in addition to the compensation to which Engineer is entitled under the terms of Exhibit C.
   1. Opinions of Cost
   1. Opinions of Probable Construction Cost
   1. Engineer’s opinions of probable Construction Cost are to be made on the basis of Engineer’s experience and qualifications and represent Engineer’s best judgment as an experienced and qualified professional generally familiar with the construction industry. However, since Engineer has no control over the cost of labor, materials, equipment, or services furnished by others, or over contractors’ methods of determining prices, or over competitive bidding or market conditions, Engineer cannot and does not guarantee that proposals, bids, or actual Construction Cost will not vary from opinions of probable Construction Cost prepared by Engineer. If Owner wishes greater assurance as to probable Construction Cost, Owner shall employ an independent cost estimator as provided in Exhibit B.
   1. Designing to Construction Cost Limit
   1. If a Construction Cost limit is established between Owner and Engineer, such Construction Cost limit and a statement of Engineer’s rights and responsibilities with respect thereto will be specifically set forth in Exhibit F, “Construction Cost Limit,” to this Agreement.
   1. Opinions of Total Project Costs
   1. The services, if any, of Engineer with respect to Total Project Costs shall be limited to assisting the Owner in collating the various cost categories which comprise Total Project Costs. Engineer assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of any opinions of Total Project Costs.

## General

 Considerations
   1. Standards of Performance
   1. The standard of care for all professional engineering and related services performed or furnished by Engineer under this Agreement will be the care and skill ordinarily used by members of the subject profession practicing under similar circumstances at the same time and in the same locality. Engineer makes no warranties, express or implied, under this Agreement or otherwise, in connection with Engineer’s services.
   1. Owner shall not be responsible for discovering deficiencies in the technical accuracy of Engineer’s services. Engineer shall correct any such deficiencies in technical accuracy without additional compensation except to the extent such corrective action is directly attributable to deficiencies in Owner-furnished information.
   1. Engineer may retain such Consultants as Engineer deems necessary to assist in the performance or furnishing of the services, subject to reasonable, timely, and substantive objections by Owner. The retention of such Consultants shall not reduce the Engineer’s obligations to Owner under this Agreement.
   1. Subject to the standard of care set forth in Paragraph 6.01.A, Engineer and its Consultants may use or rely upon design elements and information ordinarily or customarily furnished by others, including, but not limited to, specialty contractors, manufacturers, suppliers, and the publishers of technical standards.
   1. Engineer and Owner shall comply with applicable Laws and Regulations. Engineer shall comply with Owner-mandated standards that Owner has provided to Engineer in writing. This Agreement is based on these requirements as of its Effective Date. Changes to these requirements after the Effective Date of this Agreement may be the basis for modifications to Owner’s responsibilities or to Engineer’s scope of services, times of performance, and compensation.
   1. Engineer shall not be required to sign any documents, no matter by whom requested, that would result in the Engineer having to certify, guarantee, or warrant the existence of conditions whose existence the Engineer cannot ascertain. Owner agrees not to make resolution of any dispute with the Engineer or payment of any amount due to the Engineer in any way contingent upon the Engineer signing any such documents.
   1. The General Conditions for any construction contract documents prepared hereunder are to be the “Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Funding Agency Edition” as prepared by the Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee (No. C-710, 2002 Edition) unless both parties mutually agree to use other General Conditions by specific reference in Exhibit I.
   1. Engineer shall not at any time supervise, direct, or have control over Contractor’s work, nor shall Engineer have authority over or responsibility for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, or procedures of construction selected or used by Contractor, for security or safety at the Site, for safety precautions and programs incident to the Contractor’s work in progress, nor for any failure of Contractor to comply with Laws and Regulations applicable to Contractor’s furnishing and performing the Work.
   1. Engineer neither guarantees the performance of any Contractor nor assumes responsibility for any Contractor’s failure to furnish and perform the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.
   1. Engineer shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any Contractor, subcontractor, or supplier, or of any of their agents or employees or of any other persons (except Engineer’s own employees and its Consultants) at the Site or otherwise furnishing or performing any Work; or for any decision made on interpretations or clarifications of the Contract Documents given by Owner without consultation and advice of Engineer.
   1. All Contract Documents and Applications for Payment shall be subject to Agency concurrence.
   1. Design without Construction Phase Services
   1. If Engineer’s Basic Services under this Agreement do not include Project observation, or review of the Contractor’s performance, or any other Construction Phase services, then (1) Engineer’s services under this Agreement shall be deemed complete no later than the end of the Bidding or Negotiating Phase; (2) Engineer shall have no design or shop drawing review obligations during construction; (3) Owner assumes all responsibility for the application and interpretation of the Contract Documents, contract administration, construction observation and review, and all other necessary Construction Phase engineering and professional services; and (4) Owner waives any claims against the Engineer that may be connected in any way thereto.
   1. Use of Documents
   1. All Documents are instruments of service in respect to this Project, and Engineer shall retain an ownership and property interest therein (including the copyright and the right of reuse at the discretion of the Engineer) whether or not the Project is completed. Owner shall not rely in any way on any Document unless it is in printed form, signed or sealed by the Engineer or one of its Consultants.
   1. A party may rely that data or information set forth on paper (also known as hard copies) that the party receives from the other party by mail, hand delivery, or facsimile, are the items that the other party intended to send. Files in electronic media format of text, data, graphics, or other types that are furnished by one party to the other are furnished only for convenience, not reliance by the receiving party. Any conclusion or information obtained or derived from such electronic files will be at the user’s sole risk. If there is a discrepancy between the electronic files and the hard copies, the hard copies govern.
   1. Because data stored in electronic media format can deteriorate or be modified inadvertently or otherwise without authorization of the data’s creator, the party receiving electronic files agrees that it will perform acceptance tests or procedures within 60 days, after which the receiving party shall be deemed to have accepted the data thus transferred. Any transmittal errors detected within the 60-day acceptance period will be corrected by the party delivering the electronic files.
   1. When transferring documents in electronic media format, the transferring party makes no representations as to long term compatibility, usability, or readability of documents resulting from the use of software application packages, operating systems, or computer hardware differing from those used by the documents’ creator.
   1. Owner may make and retain copies of Documents for information and reference in connection with use on the Project by Owner. Engineer grants Owner a license to use the Documents on the Project, extensions of the Project, and other projects of Owner, subject to the following limitations:
      1. (1) Owner acknowledges that such Documents are not intended or represented to be suitable for use on the Project unless completed by Engineer, or for use or reuse by Owner or others on extensions of the Project or on any other project without written verification or adaptation by Engineer; (2) any such use or reuse, or any modification of the Documents, without written verification, completion, or adaptation by Engineer, as appropriate for the specific purpose intended, will be at Owner’s sole risk and without liability or legal exposure to Engineer or to Engineer’s Consultants; (3) Owner shall indemnify and hold harmless Engineer and Engineer’s Consultants from all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or resulting from any use, reuse, or modification without written verification, completion, or adaptation by Engineer; and (4) such limited license to Owner shall not create any rights in third parties.
   1. If Engineer at Owner’s request verifies or adapts the Documents for extensions of the Project or for any other project, then Owner shall compensate Engineer at rates or in an amount to be agreed upon by Owner and Engineer.
   1. Insurance
   1. Engineer shall procure and maintain insurance as set forth in Exhibit G, “Insurance.” Engineer shall cause Owner to be listed as an additional insured on any applicable general liability insurance policy carried by Engineer.
   1. Owner shall procure and maintain insurance as set forth in Exhibit G, “Insurance.” Owner shall cause Engineer and Engineer’s Consultants to be listed as additional insureds on any general liability or property insurance policies carried by Owner which are applicable to the Project.
   1. Owner shall require Contractor to purchase and maintain general liability and other insurance in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 5.04 of the “Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract, Funding Agency Edition,” (No. C-710, 2002 Edition) as prepared by the Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee and to cause Engineer and Engineer’s Consultants to be listed as additional insureds with respect to such liability and other insurance purchased and maintained by Contractor for the Project.
   1. Owner and Engineer shall each deliver to the other certificates of insurance evidencing the coverages indicated in Exhibit G. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of Engineer’s services and at renewals thereafter during the life of the Agreement.
   1. All policies of property insurance relating to the Project shall contain provisions to the effect that Engineer’s and Engineer’s Consultants’ interests are covered and that in the event of payment of any loss or damage the insurers will have no rights of recovery against Engineer or its Consultants, or any insureds or additional insureds thereunder.
   1. At any time, Owner may request that Engineer or its Consultants, at Owner’s sole expense, provide additional insurance coverage, increased limits, or revised deductibles that are more protective than those specified in Exhibit G. If so, requested by Owner, and if commercially available, Engineer shall obtain and shall require its Consultants to obtain such additional insurance coverage, different limits, or revised deductibles for such periods of time as requested by Owner, and Exhibit G will be supplemented to incorporate these requirements.
   1. Suspension and Termination

*Suspension*.
   1. By Owner:
      1. Owner may suspend the Project upon seven days written notice to Engineer.
   1. By Engineer:
      1. If Engineer’s services are substantially delayed through no fault of Engineer, Engineer may, after giving seven days written notice to Owner, suspend services under this Agreement.

*Environmental Indemnification.* In addition to the indemnity provided under paragraph 6.10.B of this Agreement, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Owner shall indemnify and hold harmless Engineer and its officers, directors, partners, agents, employees, and Consultants from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, and damages (including but not limited to all fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys and other professionals, and all court, arbitration, or other dispute resolution costs) caused by, arising out of, relating to. or resulting from a Constituent of Concern at, on, or under the Site, provided that (1) any such claim, cost, loss, or damage is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or to damage to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself), including the loss of use resulting therefrom, and (2) nothing in this paragraph shall obligate Owner to indemnify any individual or entity from and against the consequences of that individual's or entity's own negligence or willful misconduct.
   1. Percentage Share of Negligence. To the fullest extent permitted by law, a party’s total liability to the other party and anyone claiming by, through, or under the other party for any cost, loss, or damage caused in part by the negligence of the party and in part by the negligence of the other party or any other negligent entity or individual, shall not exceed the percentage share that the party’s negligence bears to the total negligence of Owner, Engineer, and all other negligent entities and individuals.

*Mutual Waiver.* To the fullest extent permitted by law, Owner and Engineer waive against each other, and the other’s employees, officers, directors, agents, insurers, partners, and consultants, any and all claims for or entitlement to special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of, resulting from, or in any way related to the Project.
