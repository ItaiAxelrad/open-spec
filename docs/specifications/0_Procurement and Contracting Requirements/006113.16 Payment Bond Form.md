12. The Contractor and Surety, jointly and severally, bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns to the Owner to pay for labor, materials, and equipment furnished for use in the performance of the Construction Contract, which is incorporated herein by reference, subject to the following terms.
13. If the Contractor promptly makes payment of all sums due to Claimants, and defends, indemnifies, and holds harmless the Owner from claims, demands, liens, or suits by any person or entity seeking payment for labor, materials, or equipment furnished for use in the performance of the Construction Contract, then the Surety and the Contractor shall have no obligation under this Bond.
14. If there is no Owner Default under the Construction Contract, the Surety’s obligation to the Owner under this Bond shall arise after the Owner has promptly notified the Contractor and the Surety (at the address described in Paragraph 13) of claims, demands, liens, or suits against the Owner or the Owner’s property by any person or entity seeking payment for labor, materials, or equipment furnished for use in the performance of the Construction Contract, and tendered defense of such claims, demands, liens, or suits to the Contractor and the Surety.
15. When the Owner has satisfied the conditions in Paragraph 3, the Surety shall promptly and at the Surety’s expense defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Owner against a duly tendered claim, demand, lien, or suit.
16. The Surety’s obligations to a Claimant under this Bond shall arise after the following: 1. Claimants who do not have a direct contract with the Contractor,
    1..1 have furnished a written notice of non-payment to the Contractor, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the materials were, or equipment was, furnished or supplied or for whom the labor was done or performed, within ninety (90) days after having last performed labor or last furnished materials or equipment included in the Claim; and
    1..2 have sent a Claim to the Surety (at the address described in Paragraph 13).
17. Claimants who are employed by or have a direct contract with the Contractor have sent a Claim to the Surety (at the address described in Paragraph 13).
18. If a notice of non-payment required by Paragraph 5.1.1 is given by the Owner to the Contractor, that is sufficient to satisfy a Claimant’s obligation to furnish a written notice of non-payment under Paragraph 5.1.1.
19. When a Claimant has satisfied the conditions of Paragraph 5.1 or 5.2, whichever is applicable, the Surety shall promptly and at the Surety’s expense take the following actions:
    1. Send an answer to the Claimant, with a copy to the Owner, within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Claim, stating the amounts that are undisputed and the basis for challenging any amounts that are disputed; and
20. Pay or arrange for payment of any undisputed amounts.
21. The Surety’s failure to discharge its obligations under Paragraph 7.1 or 7.2 shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of defenses the Surety or Contractor may have or acquire as to a Claim, except as to undisputed amounts for which the Surety and Claimant have reached agreement. If, however, the Surety fails to discharge its obligations under Paragraph 7.1 or 7.2, the Surety shall indemnify the Claimant for the reasonable attorney’s fees the Claimant incurs thereafter to recover any sums found to be due and owing to the Claimant.
22. The Surety’s total obligation shall not exceed the amount of this Bond, plus the amount of reasonable attorney’s fees provided under Paragraph 7.3, and the amount of this Bond shall be credited for any payments made in good faith by the Surety.
23. Amounts owed by the Owner to the Contractor under the Construction Contract shall be used for the performance of the Construction Contract and to satisfy claims, if any, under any construction performance bond. By the Contractor furnishing and the Owner accepting this Bond, they agree that all funds earned by the Contractor in the performance of the Construction Contract are dedicated to satisfy obligations of the Contractor and Surety under this Bond, subject to the Owner’s priority to use the funds for the completion of the work.
24. The Surety shall not be liable to the Owner, Claimants, or others for obligations of the Contractor that are unrelated to the Construction Contract. The Owner shall not be liable for the payment of any costs or expenses of any Claimant under this Bond, and shall have under this Bond no obligation to make payments to or give notice on behalf of Claimants, or otherwise have any obligations to Claimants under this Bond.
25. The Surety hereby waives notice of any change, including changes of time, to the Construction Contract or to related subcontracts, purchase orders, and other obligations.
26. No suit or action shall be commenced by a Claimant under this Bond other than in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state in which the project that is the subject of the Construction Contract is located or after the expiration of one year from the date (1) on which the Claimant sent a Claim to the Surety pursuant to Paragraph 5.1.2 or 5.2, or (2) on which the last labor or service was performed by anyone or the last materials or equipment were furnished by anyone under the Construction Contract, whichever of (1) or (2) first occurs. If the provisions of this paragraph are void or prohibited by law, the minimum period of limitation available to sureties as a defense in the jurisdiction of the suit shall be applicable.
27. Notice and Claims to the Surety, the Owner, or the Contractor shall be mailed or delivered to the address shown on the page on which their signature appears. Actual receipt of notice or Claims, however accomplished, shall be sufficient compliance as of the date received.
28. When this Bond has been furnished to comply with a statutory or other legal requirement in the location where the construction was to be performed, any provision in this Bond conflicting with said statutory or legal requirement shall be deemed deleted herefrom and provisions conforming to such statutory or other legal requirement shall be deemed incorporated herein. When so furnished, the intent is that this Bond shall be construed as a statutory bond and not as a common law bond.
29. Upon requests by any person or entity appearing to be a potential beneficiary of this Bond, the Contractor and Owner shall promptly furnish a copy of this Bond or shall permit a copy to be made.
