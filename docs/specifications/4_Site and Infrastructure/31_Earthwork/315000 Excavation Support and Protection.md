3. Professional Engineer Qualifications:
      1. 
	1. A professional engineer who is legally qualified to practice in the jurisdiction where the Project is located and who is experienced in providing engineering services for designing excavation support and protection systems that are similar to those indicated for this Project in material, design, and extent.
4. Engineering Responsibility:
      1. 
	1. Engage a qualified professional engineer to prepare or supervise the preparation of data for the excavation support and protection system including drawings and comprehensive engineering analysis that shows the system’s compliance with specified requirements.
	2. PROJECT CONDITIONS
5. Interruption of Existing Utilities:
      1. 
	1. Do not interrupt any utility serving facilities occupied by Owner or others unless permitted under the following conditions and then only after arranging to provide temporary utility according to requirements indicated.
	2. Notify Engineer not less than two days in advance of proposed utility interruptions.
	3. Do not proceed with utility interruptions without Engineer’s written permission.
6. Project-Site Information:
      1. 
	1. A geotechnical report has been prepared for this Project and is available for information only. The opinions expressed in this report are those of geotechnical engineer and represent interpretations of subsoil conditions, tests, and results of analyses conducted by geotechnical engineer. Owner will not be responsible for interpretations or conclusions drawn from the data. 
	2. The geotechnical report is included elsewhere in the Project Manual.
7. Survey Work:
      1. 
	1. Engage a qualified land surveyor or professional engineer to survey adjacent existing buildings, structures, and site improvements; establish exact elevations at fixed points to act as benchmarks. Clearly identify benchmarks and record existing elevations.
	2. During installation of excavation support and protection systems, regularly resurvey benchmarks, maintaining an accurate log of surveyed elevations and positions for comparison with original elevations and positions. Promptly notify Architect if changes in elevations or positions occur or if cracks, sags, or other damage is evident in adjacent construction.

   1. Execution

* 
	1. PREPARATION
   1. Protect structures, utilities, sidewalks, pavements, and other facilities from damage caused by settlement, lateral movement, undermining, washout, and other hazards that could develop during excavation support and protection system operations.
2. Shore, support, and protect utilities encountered.
3. Install excavation support and protection systems to ensure minimum interference with roads, streets, walks, and other adjacent occupied and used facilities.
4. Do not close or obstruct streets, walks, or other adjacent occupied or used facilities without permission from Owner and authorities having jurisdiction. Provide alternate routes around closed or obstructed traffic ways if required by authorities having jurisdiction.
5. Locate excavation support and protection systems clear of permanent construction so that forming and finishing of concrete surfaces are not impeded.
6. Monitor excavation support and protection systems daily during excavation progress and for as long as excavation remains open. Promptly correct bulges, breakage, or other evidence of movement to ensure that excavation support and protection systems remain stable.
7. Promptly repair damages to adjacent facilities caused by installing excavation support and protection systems.
	1. SOLDIER PILES AND LAGGING
8. Install steel soldier piles before starting excavation. Extend soldier piles below excavation grade level to depths adequate to prevent lateral movement. Space soldier piles at regular intervals not to exceed allowable flexural strength of wood lagging. Accurately align exposed faces of flanges to vary not more than 2 inches from a horizontal line and not more than 1:120 out of vertical alignment.
9. Install wood lagging within flanges of soldier piles as excavation proceeds. Trim excavation as required to install lagging. Fill voids behind lagging with soil, and compact.
10. Install wales horizontally at locations indicated on Drawings and secure to soldier piles.
	1. SHEET PILING
11. Before starting excavation, install one-piece sheet piling lengths and tightly interlock to form a continuous barrier. Accurately place the piling, using templates and guide frames unless otherwise recommended in writing by the sheet piling manufacturer. Limit vertical offset of adjacent sheet piling to 60 inches. Accurately align exposed faces of sheet piling to vary not more than 2 inches from a horizontal line and not more than 1:120 out of vertical alignment. Cut tops of sheet piling to uniform elevation at top of excavation.
	1. BRACING
12. Bracing: 
	1. Locate bracing to clear columns, floor framing construction, and other permanent work. If necessary, to move brace, install new bracing before removing original brace.
	2. Do not place bracing where it will be cast into or included in permanent concrete work unless otherwise approved by Architect.
	3. Install internal bracing, if required, to prevent spreading or distortion of braced frames.
	4. Maintain bracing until structural elements are supported by other bracing or until permanent construction is able to withstand lateral earth and hydrostatic pressures.
	5. REMOVAL AND REPAIRS
13. Remove excavation support and protection systems when construction has progressed sufficiently to support excavation and bear soil and hydrostatic pressures. Remove in stages to avoid disturbing underlying soils or damaging structures, pavements, facilities, and utilities.
14. Remove excavation support and protection systems to a minimum depth of 48 inches below overlaying construction and abandon remainder.
15. Fill voids immediately with approved select backfill compacted to density specified in Division 31 Section “Earth Moving.”
16. Repair or replace, as approved by Engineer, adjacent work damaged or displaced by removing excavation support and protection systems.
