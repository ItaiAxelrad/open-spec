## General


	1. RELATED DOCUMENTS
   1. Drawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary Conditions and Division 01 Specification Sections, apply to this Section.
   1. All current Owner standards and specifications shall apply, including but not limited to:
      1. Owner CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
1. SUMMARY
		1. Finish grading associated with the proposed drainage swale and guidance for grading adjacent to the existing transformer pad.
   1. Scope of Work:
      1. Fine grading to meet all required finish elevations indicated on the Drawings; including distribution of top-soil over the site; and coordination with installation of sodding and landscaping.
   1. Disc the existing and / or filled subgrade to a depth of 6 inches using a landscape scarifier.
   1. Remove all roots, rocks, stumps, trash and all construction debris prior to rough grading.
   1. Following the removal of all foreign materials, and when the rough grading is completed, provide and place previously stripped material or silty or sandy clay material in the amounts required to bring the rough grade to within 2 inches of finish grade.
   1. Assure bonding of layers of fill material by discing in compliance with the specifications.
   1. Spread 2 inches of topsoil over graded areas after rough grading has been completed and approved. 
   1. Topsoil previously stripped and stockpiled may be used, provided it meets all requirements for topsoil (Re:
      1. Section 31 15 00 - Site Clearing and Earthwork). 
   1. The Contractor shall furnish all additional topsoil that may be required to provide finish elevations. 
   1. Existing topsoil and additional topsoil fill material shall be free of debris, stumps, roots and stones larger than 3/4 inch diameter. 
   1. Samples of topsoil shall be submitted to the Architect and Owner for approval prior to installation. 
   1. Topsoil must be suitable for rapid grass growth with little to no clay.
   1. Final and fine grading shall be done using a tractor pulled landscape rake and hand raking, removing all debris immediately prior to landscaping / hydro mulching. The final graded ground surface shall be relatively smooth, free of organic material and all construction material debris; and in suitable condition to commence landscaping work

	1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   1. The Contractor will be responsible to maintain and control the grading around the building so that the grade is pitched to prevent water from entering the building and/or accumulating in the graded areas throughout the progress of the work.
2. Utilities and other remaining obstacles shall be properly identified prior to commencement of the final grading.
3. Testing Laboratory Services. Test results shall meet or exceed the standards.
4. American Society for Testing and Materials:

## Product
1. MATERIALS
   1. Refer to Section 31 15 00 – Site Clearing and Earthwork for description of fill and topsoil materials.


## Execution

1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Preparation:
2. Upon completion of grading and prior to placement of topsoil, Contract shall thoroughly remove all construction debris, weeds, foreign plants, rocks 3/4" diameter or larger, and other non-soil materials.
3. Remove by hand or hand rake if / where necessary.
4. Inspection:
5. The Contractor, prior to placing any topsoil, shall contact the Architect and Owner when the grading is complete and all foreign materials have been removed, to review these areas for compliance with the contract requirements. 
6. Prior to placement of any topsoil, the Architect and Owner will review with the Contractor the areas designated complete and ready for final grading.
7. The topsoil installation shall proceed immediately when the designated areas have been reviewed and determined acceptable
8. The Contractor shall contact the Architect and Owner to review the areas when the topsoil has been placed, debris removed, and all final grading has been completed. This review shall occur prior to any sodding, seeding, hydromulching, and/or other landscaping operations proceeding within these designated areas.
9. Any construction materials, discovered or uncovered during and / or after the landscaping / sodding operations, shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to remove and replace each area to its finished condition.
2. INSTALLATION
   1.  Work under this section consists generally of the following operations:
2. Disc the existing and / or filled subgrade to a depth of 6 inches using a landscape scarifier.
3. Place topsoil material in the amounts required to bring the rough grade to within 2 inches of finish sodded grade; and within 1” of areas to receive hydromulch. 
4. Assure bonding of layers of fill material by discing in compliance with the specifications.
5. Final and fine grading shall be done using a tractor pulled landscape rake and hand raking, removing all debris immediately prior to landscaping / sodding / hydro-mulching. The final graded ground surface shall be relatively smooth, free of organic material and all construction material debris; and in suitable condition to commence landscaping work.
6. Solid Sodded Areas:
7. Grading at areas to receive solid sodding shall account for nominal thickness of root base / soil included in the solid sod blankets. 
8. Grading at solid sodded area at building perimeter shall result in top of grass blanket soil flush with the bottom of the brick ledge, sidewalks and flatwork; unless shown otherwise on the Drawings. 
9. Sodding shall not impede the drainage of water off or over sidewalks and flatwork. 
10. Where solid sodding adjoins areas of hydro-mulched sodding, grade area to provide a level transition from one sodded area to the other after grass / hydromulch is established and fully rooted.
3. PROTECTION AND MAINTENANCE
   1. The Contractor shall be responsible for the protecting and maintaining completed finish grading prior to the start of sodding and landscape work by the Owner. 
2. Damage caused by surface run-off, construction vehicular traffic, use of equipment or other Contractor controlled activities shall immediately be repaired and restored to originally accepted state.
