## Execution

1. 3.1 Trench Excavation
	 1. General: Limit operations to as small an area as possible in order to minimize damage to adjacent property. If necessary clear and grub the area to be excavated. In areas where topsoil exists remove and salvage the topsoil for replacement. Keep topsoil segregated from other excavation materials.
	1. The maximum amount of trench left open at one time shall be limited to 100-feet or such length as the Engineer considers reasonable and necessary. No trench shall be left open overnight unless specified otherwise in the Special Provisions.
	2. A guide for desirable trench width at the top of the pipe shall be the nominal diameter of the pipe plus 12-inches on each side of the pipe.
	3. All utility lines and water courses met shall be maintained and provided for by the Contractor without damage, or nuisance to other parties. Shoring, bracing, sheeting, other trench support methods, and trench boxes shall be used when necessary to protect the work, property and persons. The need, appropriateness and adequacy of all such devices shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.
2. Alignment and Grade:
      1. The trench shall be excavated so that the pipe can be installed to the alignment and grade indicated on the drawings or specified. Under certain field conditions, Mount Werner Water may authorize a water main to be installed with less than or more than the specified minimum cover. Authorization must be granted prior to installation. All such authorizations will be provided in writing.
	1. It is the Contractor’s responsibility to plan far enough in advance of pipe laying operations to allow grade adjustments to be implemented to provide proper clearances when crossing existing utilities.
	2. In subdivision work, or other work requiring changes to existing grade along the centerline of a proposed pipeline, the changes shall be made to subgrade elevation prior to installation of the line.
3. Dewatering:
      1. The Contractor shall provide all necessary dewatering equipment and procedures necessary for excluding and removing water from trenches, and other parts of the work.
	1. The Trench shall be maintained dry so that the work may be completed efficiently, and pipes can be laid, joined, bedded, inspected and backfilled in dewatered conditions. The pipe shall not be used to dewater the trench. No water shall be allowed to flow over or rise upon fresh concrete or mortar, and no water shall be allowed to enter the pipe.
	2. The water shall be disposed of by the Contractor in accordance with the Contract Documents and applicable laws and regulations. The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary dewatering or discharge permits and complying with their requirements.
1. 3.2 Foundation
	 1. General: Verify that a sound stable trench bottom free from soft, lose, rocky, excessively hard or other unsuitable native material exists before proceeding
2. Required Foundation:
      1. Install imported foundation material at all locations specifically required by the Drawings or Specification.
3. Unsuitable Foundation:
      1. Where unsuitable foundation is encountered over excavate the trench bottom to the depth authorized by the Engineer and bring the foundation to grade with the appropriate imported foundation material authorized by the Engineer and compacted in lifts to 90 percent of maximum dry density.
1. 3.3 Bedding and Shading
	 1. General: Holes for pipe bells shall be provided at each joint. Bell holes shall be no larger than necessary for joint assembly and assurance that the pipe barrel will lie flat on the trench bottom. Generally, 2-inches of clearance beneath the joint is desired. Push-on type joints require minimum depressions for bell holes. In no case shall the bell support the weight of the pipe at the time of shading and backfill. Under no circumstances shall the pipe be permanently joined in the trench until the trench bottom has been fine graded to provide uniform pipe support at the required invert elevation.
2. Required Embedment:
      1. Imported bedding and shading materials are required for all main-line pipes and appurtenances.
3. Procedures and Bedding and Shading:
      1. The following procedure shall be used for all types of pipe. Special care is required in the embedment Zone to assure proper filling and compaction of materials beneath pipe haunches and to avoid displacing or damaging the pipe. Bedding and shading materials shall be placed in a minimum of two lifts. The thickness of the first lift shall not exceed the pipe spring line. Following placement of the first lift a “tee bar” shall be used to compact loose material under the pipe haunches. The use of the end of a shovel handle to compact under pipe haunches is not considered an acceptable alternative to a “tee bar”. Mechanical compaction may be required at the first lift as well as succeeding lifts for pipe diameters larger than 12-inches or where dictated by trench width.
	1. Depending on the diameter of the pipe being installed, installation of shading materials may require a single lift or multiple lifts. Lift thickness from the spring line or top of bedding to the top of shading shall not exceed 18-inches.
	2. Shading Zone materials shall be placed by hand shoveling, or by careful placement with a Backhoe. Dumping or shoving excavated materials over the trench sidewall, and “chipping” of soil from the top of the trench are not considered acceptable means of shading the pipe. Shading Zone materials shall be compacted to 92 percent of maximum dry density. The method of compaction used by the Contractor to obtain the required density is subject to the Engineer’s review. If the specified compaction is not being obtained, the Contractor will be required to modify his compaction procedures to meet specified requirements. This may require the use of other types of compaction equipment or a reduction in size of lifts being compacted.
	3. Any damages to the pipe that occurs from improper compaction procedures or the use of mechanical compaction too close to the pipe shall immediately be repaired by the Contractor. If compaction equipment which is narrower than full trench width is used, the equipment shall be operated first on each side of the pipe between the edge of the pipe and the trench walls and then centered over the pipe.
	4. Horizontal placement of bedding and shading shall extend the full trench width to undisturbed trench width to undisturbed trench wall material.
1. 3.4 Trench Backfill
	 1. General: Backfill materials shall be placed in lifts and compacted to 95 percent. Road crossings will in general, be backfilled with imported material. All excavation and backfill within the City Right of Way shall follow all current City requirements at the time of construction.
	1. Salvaged topsoil shall be replaced to its approximate original depth in all open areas and areas to be re-vegetated.
2. For Manholes Located in Gravel or Paved Areas:
      1. Backfill materials shall be compacted to 95 percent in lifts recommended not to exceed 6-inches.
3. Deviations of material moisture content:
	1. Excessive moisture content: The Contractor shall attempt to dry wet backfill material to a moisture content suitable for backfilling. If wet native backfill cannot be compacted to the specified requirements after reasonable drying effort by the Contractor, the Engineer may waive the compaction requirement, or may authorize the Contractor to use imported backfill material. Where only the upper portion of the trench section is backfilled with imported material the Contractor shall install geotextiles as authorized by the Engineer to separate the imported and native materials.
	2. Insufficient moisture content: Where compaction requirements cannot be met because of insufficient moisture content, the Contractor will be required to add moisture to the material as required for proper compaction.
4. Flooding and Jetting of Trenches:
      1. Flooding or jetting of trenches shall not be permitted.
1. 3.5 Waste
   1. It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to remove all excess materials or unsuitable materials remaining from excavation, trenching or other work and dispose of the same in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
1. 3.6 Quality Control
   1. Compaction:
      1. The degree of bedding or backfill compaction specified shall be 95 percent of maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D 1557, Modified Proctor. The moisture content of bedding or backfill materials shall be within 2.0 percent of optimum moisture as determined by ASTM D 1557.
	1. Compaction testing shall include moisture density relations, and density in place. If compaction testing, or other visual observations, indicate the possibility of inadequate compaction at a lower depth, the Engineer may require the Contractor or re-excavate a lower depth to conduct additional testing.
	2. When requested by the Engineer the Contractor shall proof roll the trench with a loaded front end loader or truck of sufficient size to determine if soft spots exist.
	3. If the tests indicate inadequate compaction, the Contractor shall re-compact the material. In cases where there is repeated failure to achieve the required state of compaction, the Engineer may require that the backfill be removed and re-compacted in 6-inch lifts or replaced with imported material at the Contractor’s expense.
2. Testing frequency shall be as required to assure the completed work meets specifications but shall be no less than the following:
	1. In the City of Steamboat Springs Right-of-Way – use the City of Steamboat Springs testing frequency specifications.
	2. Out of the City of Steamboat Springs Right-of-Way - An average of one test for every other lift per type of material placed per 250 linear foot of trench. Additional testing is recommended near manholes, valve boxes and key fill areas.
3. Testing Quality of Materials:
      1. All material proposed to be imported from off site shall be sampled and tested by the Contractor. Sampling procedures shall result in samples that are representative of the actual materials delivered to the project site.
	1. Class 6 Aggregate Base Course shall be tested for conformance with section 703.03 of the Standard Specifications.
	2. Washed rock shall be tested for gradation.
	3. Imported Pit Run shall be tested for AASHTO soil classification plasticity index, liquid limit and gradation.
4. Trench Settlement:
		1. General: Variations in soil type and moisture conditions along with inconsistencies in compactive effort may cause settlement to occur in portions of the backfill. The specified compaction requirements shall be considered a minimum. Spot testing for in place density by the Engineer during construction shall not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to assure that the trench backfill does not settle beyond the limits established below. The Contractor shall be responsible for repair of areas of excessive settlement.
	2. Measurement: Measurement of settlement shall generally take place in July or August, one winter season following completion of trench backfill.
	3. Limits: The following limits to trench backfill settlement shall apply.
		1. Asphaltic Concrete Paved Areas: Settlement greater than 1/2 inch but less than 1-1/2 inches shall be repaired by removing the asphalt to a minimum of 2 feet on either side of the settled area and replacing it with a new, thicker section of asphalt to produce a final level surface. Settlement greater than 1-1/2 inches shall be repaired by removing the asphalt and recompacting or replacing the trench backfill and gravels then applying a new asphalt surface.
		2. Gravel Surfaces: The Contractor shall add additional compacted gravel to trenches where settlements are less than 1-1/2 inches. In cases where the settlement is greater than 1-1/2 inches the Contractor shall be required to replace and recompact backfill material as necessary.
	4. Warranty: When settlement of trenches necessitates repair, the warranty period for the trench repairs shall be extended one year beyond the time of the repairs.
