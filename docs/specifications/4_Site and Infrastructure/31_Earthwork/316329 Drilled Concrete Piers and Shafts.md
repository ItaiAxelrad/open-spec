## Execution

   1. preparation
   1. Layout of the Work
   1. Employ a registered surveyor to perform surveys, layout and measurements for drilled piers. Establish lines and levels for the drilled pier Work before excavation and record actual measurements of each drilled pier’s location, shaft diameter, bottom and top elevations and other pertinent data.
   1. Be entirely responsible for and bear entire cost of correcting any mislocated piers or incorrect cut-off levels at pier tops.
   1. Protection
   1. Protect adjoining properties from damage, and exercise extreme care in performing the Work so as not to impair the safety of adjoining structures. Provide OSHA-approved barricading and/or fall protection around or over holes at all times.
   1. Safety Precautions
   1. Exercise safety precautions and comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws and ordinances to protect workmen from bodily injury.
   1. Gas Protection
   1. Maintain the air in the drilled piers fresh and free of gas, adequate for the health of workmen and free from explosive hazards. Provide gas detection equipment and constantly check the presence of gas in the shaft. Protection devices, gas detection equipment, health and explosion safety standards meeting requirements of public authorities having jurisdiction are required.
   1. If gas is found in an amount constituting an explosion or health hazard, suspend Work in the drilled pier until the air is made safe for Work by special ventilation methods.
   1. installation
   1. Excavation
   1. Excavate drilled piers to design diameters to the indicated lengths and penetration depths maintaining sidewall stability during drilling. Make frequent checks on plumbness of shaft during excavation.
   1. Excavate pier bottom to a level plane and remove all loose materials.
   1. Remove excavated material and dispose as specified in Section 02312.
   1. Control of Water
   1. Prevent surface and ground water from entering excavated shafts.
   1. Dewater drilled pier excavation prior to placing concrete in a manner that will not create subsidence and ground loss that might adversely affect the Work and existing adjacent structures.
   1. If water inflow is considered excessive by the Testing Agency for suitable withdrawal of water, follow procedure specified for placing concrete under water.
   1. Provide settling basins and screens and necessary treatment to prevent the discharge of debris, mud, and objectionable contamination into the public sewer system. Discharge debris, mud and other contamination off the site. Clean sewers obstructed and contaminated by such discharge.
   1. Steel Casing
   1. Install steel casing for shaft excavation where required for protection against cave-ins, ground subsidence or water. Make diameter of excavation relative to diameter of casing such as to create minimum void space outside of casing.
   1. Reinforcing Steel
   1. Upon certification by the Testing Agency that drilled pier excavation is completed and accepted, place reinforcing steel.
   1. Keep reinforcing steel free of mud, oil or other surface contamination that adversely affects bond.
   1. Provide reinforcing steel cover as indicated on drawings.
   1. Place reinforcement without any kinks or unspecified bends and comply with the applicable requirements Section 03300, unless otherwise specified.
   1. Lap splices as defined on the drawings are permitted at the bottom of piers only.
   1. Place reinforcing before concreting begins.
   1. Protect exposed ends of extended reinforcingfrom mechanical damage and exposure to weather.
   1. Concreting
   1. Comply with the applicable requirement of Section 03300, unless otherwise specified.
   1. Place concrete immediately after completion of excavation and acceptance by the Testing Agency. Do not leave excavation open overnight.
   1. Convey concrete from truck to drilled piers as rapidly as mixing is completed using a method that prevents segregation or loss of ingredients.
   1. Concrete in dry shafts may be pumped or placed by the free-fall method provided it is directed so that fall is vertical down center of shaft without hitting sides or reinforcement.
   1. Place concrete continuously, without interruption, to the top of drilled pier. Where the pour is stopped for over one hour for reasons beyond the Contractor's control, level the construction joint thus formed, clean the joint of all laitance and slush the surface with one-to-one grout of cement and sand before resuming pour. If there is no vertical reinforcement at this joint, provide vertical dowels equal to 0.005 times the cross sectional area of shaft and of sufficient lengths to develop bars below and above joints set in the concrete.
   1. Protect top of pier against damage and cure protect to prevent moisture loss and temperature extremes as per Section 03300.
   1. Fill any void between permanent casing and shaft excavation with sand-cement grout.
   1. For placing concrete underwater, use tremie pipe or concrete pumping with procedure as accepted by the Engineer.
   1. Casing Withdrawal
   1. Provide means and opportunity to Testing Agency to inspect the operation during withdrawal of casing and placing of concrete.
   1. Withdraw casing as the concrete is placed, provided that a sufficient head of concrete (3 meters (10 feet) minimum) is maintained above the bottom of casing or the level of the ground water trapped outside of casing (whichever is higher in elevation) to prevent reduction in diameter of the shaft by earth pressure, or contamination of concrete by ground water or soil, or the creation of voids.
   1. Withdraw casing smoothly and keep plumb. An initial jerk of not more than 100 mm (four inches) is allowed, but keep to a minimum to avoid disturbance of the freshly placed concrete.
   1. Check concrete level prior to, during, and after withdrawing casing to confirm separation of shaft concrete has not occurred.
   1. Tolerances
   1. Tolerances for drilled pier construction shall conform to ACI 3336.1.
   1. field quality control
   1. Inspection and Testing
   1. Employment of Testing Agency as specified in Section 01450 is by Owner to provide inspection of the drilled pier construction and determine the acceptability of pier installation within the terms and condition of the Contract Documents.
   1. Assist the Testing Agency in making tests and indirect measurements from the top of the shaft in each pier bottom and in carrying out other investigations as may be required.
   1. To facilitate the specified tests, notify all concerned, at least 6 hours prior to the time excavation is ready for inspection. Consequences of and costs arising from delays incurred through lack of notification are the responsibility of the Contractor.
   1. Cleaning
   1. Upon completion of the Work, remove tools, equipment and rubbish resulting from the construction.
