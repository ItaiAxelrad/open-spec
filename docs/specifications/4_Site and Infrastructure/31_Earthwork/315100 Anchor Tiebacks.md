## Execution

1. PREPARATION
   1. Identify required lines, levels, contours, and datum.
   1. Existing Utilities:
      1. Verify the location of active utilities protect them from harm to prevent damage and to maintain their use. Consult the University if utility lines or piping are encountered during drilling of anchors. Use care in drilling so that the following indications of utilities in the way will be recognized.
   1. Abnormal resistance to drilling.
   1. Foreign material pulled from the hole.
   1. Notify the Project Manager prior to removing and/or relocating utilities. 
   1. Protect above and below grade utilities which are to remain.
   1. Protect plant life, lawns, and other features remaining as a portion of final landscaping.
   1. Protect bench marks, existing structures, fences, sidewalks, paving, and curbs from excavation equipment and vehicular traffic.
   1. CORROSION PROTECTION OF PERMANENT TIEBACK ANCHORS
   1. Anchorage assembly shall include a bearing plate, washer and nut. Steel pipe (trumpet) and studs shall also be included in the anchorage assembly where required. Trumpet pipe shall have a minimum thickness of 0.2” and be sized to fit over the rod and corrugation. Anchorage assembly shall be hot-dipped galvanized.
1. INSTALLATION
   1. Drilling:
      1. Drill holes for the tiebacks at the locations indicated in the plans. A tolerance of plus or minus 3 degrees will be permitted on the angle of inclination and plus or minus 6 inches on the location. Minimum embedded length of the stressing length shall be as shown on the drawings.
   1. Drilling equipment shall be suitable for the strata encountered. Drilling may be accomplished by rotary or percussion methods. The method selected shall not cause cavitation or subsidence of the soils in and around the site.
   1. The Subcontractor shall be responsible for re-drilling, if necessary, anchor that otherwise does not provide a suitable anchorage as required per the specification and shall do so at its expense.
   1. The Subcontractor shall notify the University’s Geotechnical Engineer at least 5 working days in advance of the beginning of tieback drilling or the resumption of drilling after stoppage. Any hole drilled or tieback installed without continuous observation by the University’s Geotechnical Engineer will be rejected.
   1. Grouting Tiebacks:
      1. The grouting equipment shall include a mixer capable of producing a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement. The grout pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge to monitor grout pressures. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the entire tieback to be grouted in one continuous operation. Neat cement grouts shall be screened to remove lumps. The maximum size of the screen openings shall be 0.25 inches (6.4mm). Mixing and storage times shall not cause excessive temperature build up in the grout. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
   1. Portland cement grout shall be injected at the lowest point of the tieback after installation of tieback. Grout tubes shall be used to place the grout. Grouting pressure shall not be less than 60 psi at the pump. The quantity of grout and the grout pressure shall be recorded.
   1. Anchors shall be grouted with Portland cement grout for the full length of the hole to within 6 inches of [the ground surface] [back of the pier].
   1. When the grout has attained the minimum compressive strength load test the anchor (see Paragraph 3.04). After successfully load testing the anchor lock off at the post tension force specified on the drawings and fill the trumpet with Portland cement grout. The exposed surfaces of the anchor shall be covered by a metal cap filled with Portland cement grout.
   1. Continue to the next tieback (if any) and repeat the above procedure.
   1. LOAD TESTING 
   1. Test each anchor. The maximum load test shall not exceed 80% of the guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon. Stressing shall not start before the grout has reached a compressive strength of 3500 psi (24.1 MPa). The first three production anchors shall be performance tested. Other anchors shall be proof tested. Lift-off test shall be performed on the anchors for which performance test was carried out.
   1. Performance test shall be made by incrementally loading and unloading the anchor in accordance with the load schedule. At each increment the movement of the tendon shall be recorded to the nearest 0.001 inches (0.25 mm) with respect to an independent fixed reference point. The jack load shall be monitored with a pressure gauge calibrated with the jack and accurate enough to read 100 psi (0.069 MPa) changes in pressure. The pump shall be capable of applying each load increment in less than 60 seconds. A calibrated master gauge shall be kept on the site to periodically check the test gauge. The increment of load shall be as follows:
      1. AL 0.25P
   1. AL 0.25 P 0.50P
   1. AL 0.25P 0.50P 0.75P
   1. AL 0.25P 0.50P 0.75P 1.00P
   1. AL 0.25P 0.50P 0.75P 1.00P 1.20P
   1. AL 0.25P 0.50P 0.75P 1.00P 1.20P 1.33P Test Load (10 minutes)
   1. AL
   1. Adjust to Lock-Off load where:
      1. P = Design Load AL = Alignment Load
   1. The load shall be held at each increment just long enough to obtain movement reading. Except for the reading of the residual movement at AL, no movement reading needs to be taken during unloading of the anchor. The test load shall be held for 10 minutes. Total movements with respect to a fixed reference point shall be recorded at 1 minute, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 minutes. If the total movement between 1 minute and 10 minute exceeds 0.04 inches the test load shall be held for additional 50 minutes. Total movements shall be recorded at 15 minutes, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The Test Load time shall start when the Test Load is reached.
   1. Proof test shall be performed by incrementally loading the anchors in accordance with the load schedule. At each increment the movement of the tendon shall be recorded to the nearest 0.001 inches (0.25 mm) with respect to an independent fixed reference point. The jack load shall be monitored with a pressure gauge or load cell. The increments of load shall be as follows:
      1. AL
25.P 
50.P 
75.P 
00.P 
20.P 
33.P Test Load (10 minutes)
    1. Adjust to Lock-Off load
   1. The load shall be held at each increment just long enough to obtain movement reading but not more than for 1 minute. The test load shall be held for 10 minutes. Total movements with respect to a fixed reference point shall be recorded at 1 minute, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 minutes. If the total movement between 1 minute and 10 minute exceeds 0.04 inches the test load shall be held for additional 50 minutes. Total movements shall be recorded at 15 minutes, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The Test Load time shall start when the pump begins to load the anchor from the 1.20P load to the Test Load. The proof test results shall be compared to the performance test results. The University’s Geotechnical Engineer will determine whether there is significant variation from the performance test results. Significant variations from the performance test results will require performance test on the anchor. 
   1. Lift-Off test shall be performed on the same anchors for which performance test was carried out. 
   1. After transferring the load to the stressing anchorage and prior to removing the jack, a lift-off reading shall be made. The load determined from the lift-off reading shall be within 5% of the specified lock-off load. If the load is not within 5% of the lock-off load, the end anchorage shall be reset and another lift-off reading shall be made. An additional lift-off test shall be performed on initial performance test anchors 7 days after the load was locked-off in the anchor. Additional lift-off test shall be performed as required to verify production lock-off load and when requested by the engineer.
   1. The University reserves the right to perform Creep Test in accordance with provision of "Recommendations Pre-stressed Rock and Soil Anchors" of Post-Tensioning Institute if warranted by the results of the Performance Test. The Subcontractor's compensation by the University for the test will be on a time and material basis.
