## Execution

1. EXAMINATION
   1. Verify with the University prior to use whether fill materials to be reused are acceptable.
   1. Verify with the University if foundation perimeter drainage installation has been inspected.
1. PREPARATION
   1. Control dust throughout backfill operations.
   1. Compact subgrade to density requirements for subsequent backfill materials. Cut out soft areas of subgrade not capable of in situ compaction. Backfill with the type of material indicated on the Drawings and compact to density equal to or greater than requirements for subsequent backfill material.
   1. Prior to placement of aggregate base course material at paved areas, compact subsoil to 95 percent of its maximum dry density at optimum water content –1 percent + 3 percent in accordance with ASTM D1557 to the depth as indicated on the Drawings, but not less than 6 inch (150 mm).
   1. BACKFILLING
   1. Backfill areas to contours and elevations with specified materials after the University has inspected and tested the prepared subgrade to its satisfaction.
   1. Systematically backfill by mechanical means. Do not backfill over porous, wet, or spongy subgrade surfaces.
   1. Place geotextile fabric as shown on the drawings.
   1. Type A, C or D Fill:
      1. Place and compact materials in continuous layers not exceeding 6 inch (150 mm)compacted depth.
   1. Type B Fill - Aggregate Base Class 2:
      1. Placement of aggregate base shall not proceed until the Subcontractor has obtained the University approval for compaction and grading of the subbase. Class 2 Aggregate Base shall be placed in accordance with the requirements of the applicable provisions of Section 26 of CALTRANS Standard Specifications.
   1. Type E or F Fill:
      1. Place and compact material in continuous layers not exceeding 6 inch (150 mm)compacted depth under structures, roads or site structures, and eight inches compacted depth in other areas.
   1. Employ a placement method that does not disturb or damage foundation perimeter drainage or foundation waterproofing.
   1. Maintain moisture content of backfill materials within –1 percent to +3 percent of optimum to attain required compaction density.
   1. Do not backfill against unsupported foundation walls unless approved by the University.
   1. Slope grade away from building minimum two inches in 10 ft (50 mm in 3 m) **[Insert Option Here]**, unless noted otherwise.
   1. Make grade changes gradual. Blend slope into level areas.
   1. Remove surplus excavated materials from site.
   1. Leave fill material stockpile areas completely free of excess fill materials.
   1. Surveying of utilities by the University surveyor will be in accordance with Division 01 Section "Special Procedures". Identification tape and tracer wire shall be installed above utilities in accordance with Division 01 Section "Special Procedures".
   1. Buried utilities shall not be covered with backfill without the approval of the University Inspectors. Before backfilling over the identification tape and tracer wire, the University Inspector shall verify that the tape and wire have been installed. The identification tape shall not be covered with backfill without the approval of the University Inspectors.
   1. TOLERANCES
   1. Top Surface of Backfilling Under Paved Areas:
      1. The surface of the finished aggregate base at any point shall not vary more than **[1/2-inch]** [**13 mm**] above or below the grade shown on the Drawings.
   1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Tests and analysis of fill material and compaction tests will be performed in accordance with ASTM standards listed in 1.2, above.
   1. If tests indicate work does not meet specified requirements, remove work, replace and retest at no cost to University.
   1. Frequency of Compaction Tests:
      1. One per 1,000 cubic yards, but not less than one per layer of fill and not less than one per day.
   1. Proof Rolling:
      1. Prior to backfilling, proof roll areas under site improvements in the presence of the University with a heavy rubber tired vehicle to detect soft zones. The University will determine what areas are soft zones and the corrective measures required.
   1. PROTECTION OF FINISHED WORK
   1. Protect finished work.
   1. Recompact fills subjected to vehicular traffic.
   1. SCHEDULE (unless otherwise noted on the Drawings)
   1. One foot wide layer on exterior side of foundation walls, and behind retaining walls and over foundation perimeter drainage.
