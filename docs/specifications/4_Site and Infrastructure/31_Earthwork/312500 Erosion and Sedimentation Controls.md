## General

1. SUMMARY
   1. Work Included. Furnish, install, maintain, and remove temporary erosion and sedimentation controls as shown on the drawings or specified herein, or as required to complete the work.
   1. Applicability. The specific requirements identified in this section conform to those of the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit for Discharges from Construction Activities (referred to in this section as the EPA CGP). These requirements must be adhered to at Owner’s South Table Mountain and National Wind Technology Center campuses. Construction projects that occur at other locations which are permitted through the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment or other agency must follow the specific requirements of that agency’s stormwater permit which may be more stringent that those of the EPA CGP, as identified in this Section.
   1. Related Sections.
   1. Drawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary Conditions and Division 1 Specification Sections, apply if provided, to this Section.
   1. Additional information concerning temporary erosion and sedimentation control may be found on the civil drawings. In case of conflict between the drawings, jurisdictional criteria and the information specified herein, the more stringent requirements shall govern.

   1. The Owner EHS Office must approve placement and installation of BMPs prior to issuance of an Owner Penetration or Excavation Permit and subsequently, prior to the start of earth disturbance.
1. EXAMINATION
   1. Verification of Conditions:
      1. Examine areas and conditions under which the work of this section will be performed. Do not proceed with the work until unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected. Commencement of work implies acceptance of all areas and conditions.

   1. Remove accumulated sediment and debris from a BMP when the sediment level reaches one-half the height of the BMP, or at any time the sediment or debris adversely impacts the functioning of the BMP.
   1. Utilize existing vegetation as much as possible to augment sediment filtration from the construction site.
   1. A 50-foot vegetated buffer is required adjacent to Owner site drainage channels.
   1. Silt fences shall be installed for sediment filtration and erosion control, not for identifying the construction area limits of disturbance.
   1. Locate vehicle tracking control pads at all points of vehicular ingress and egress to the construction site. Recycled concrete aggregate is NOT permitted.
   1. All roadways must be kept free of dirt and swept regularly. At a minimum, roadways must be swept at the end of each working day if dirt has been tracked onto site roadways. Street sweeping operations must not result in particulate air emissions.
   1. Protect existing storm inlets adjacent to construction sites with an appropriate filtering mechanism.
   1. Construct silt dams or sediment basins to contain silt/sediment from construction site runoff. The design and sediment capacity of these controls shall be at a minimum, in conformance with Urban Drainage Criteria Manual, Volume 3. Prior to removal, obtain concurrence of the Owner EHS Office and Owner Project Manager.
   1. Provide temporary swales to convey site runoff to the existing water quality ponds, to the adjacent drainage or to other locations as approved by Owner.
   1. Locate sediment controls/barriers at the perimeter of stockpiled soils, provide cover or other means of stabilizing (tackifier, temporary seeding and mulching, erosion control blankets/matting, etc.) to limit contact with precipitation and prevent erosion and sedimentation.

   1. Initiate soil stabilization measures on soil stockpiles when the pile will remain idle for a period of 14 calendar days or more.
   1. Placement of soil stabilization measures, such as tackifiers, temporary seeding and mulching, erosion control blankets/matting, etc.) must be completed as soon as practicable but no later than 14 days after initiation of soil stabilization measures.

Please refer to Section 4.1.4 of the EPA CGP. Please also note that for construction sites covered under CDPHE’s Stormwater Discharges Associated w/ Construction Activities general permit, inspections are required when any storm (regardless of the precipitation amount) or snowmelt event occurs that is capable of causing erosion and sedimentation.

   1. Controls Remaining During Vegetation Establishment. Some erosion and sediment controls may be required to remain in newly seeded/planted areas to prevent erosion during establishment. These controls must be approved by the Owner EHS Office. All erosion and sediment controls that are to be left in place during vegetation establishment must be thoroughly cleaned at the conclusion of construction activities prior to the contractor leaving the site.
   1. Cleaning of Owner Drainage Infrastructure. Contractor must remove all sediment from Owner drainage infrastructure following completion of site stabilization activities. Contractor must also repair drainage conveyances, erosion or other damage to Owner drainage infrastructure including detention basins. This may include sediment removal, regrading, reseeding and/or application of mulch or erosion control blankets.
