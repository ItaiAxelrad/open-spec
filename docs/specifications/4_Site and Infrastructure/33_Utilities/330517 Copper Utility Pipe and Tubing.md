			1. Related Installation Specification: Pipe shall be installed in accord with the requirements of Section 15051, Installation of Pressure Pipelines.

   1. Pipe/Tubing Preparation:
      1. Cut tubing square using a cutter designed for cutting copper tubing and remove burrs.. Both the inside and outside of fitting and pipe ends shall be cleaned with steel wool and muriatic acid before soldering. Care shall be taken to prevent annealing by over-heating of fittings and tubing when making connections. Miter joints shall not be permitted in lieu of elbows. Notching straight runs of pipe in lieu of tees shall not be permitted.

    1. Any damage to the fitting including but not limited to evidence of over tightening, misaligned threads, burring or scarring of machined faces, or any evidence of leakage shall be cause for rejection. If a leak is found to be caused by debris, the debris shall be cleared and the fitting visually inspected for damage before being charged. If the leak recurs upon charging of the line, the fitting shall be removed and replaced whether or not the cause can be determined.
