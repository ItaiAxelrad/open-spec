   1. length of the proposed concrete trench system showing water
   1. within 1 foot (300 mm) of the
   1. lowest point of water entry.
   1. 5 year - 7 day rainfall equal to or less than
   1. 10 inches (250 mm). (See Note 2)
   1. Continuous wall and bottom.

   1. 10 inches (250 mm).
   1. Same as for A. above
   1. Water table generally 2 feet

(600 mm) or more below point of water entry with not more
   1. than 10% of the length of trench system showing water within 2 feet (600 mm) but not closer than 1 foot (300 mm) to lowest
   1. point of water entry.
   1. 5 year - 7 day rainfall equal to or less than 8
   1. inches (200 mm). (See

   1. Continuous wall;
   1. openings may be provided in trench bottom to provide drainage.

(See Note 3)
   1. Same as for A. above.
   1. Same as for A. above.
   1. Same as for A. above plus design of joint spacing and joint details to accommodate movement.
   1. NOTES:
         1. Shallow concrete trench system shall not be used if any conditions defined by these criteria are exceeded.
2. As shown in U. S. Weather Bureau (USWB) Technical Paper 40 and confirmed with local data and local weather patterns
3. Swelling soils are materials with high swell potential when subjected to an increase in moisture content.
4. Precipitation rates for a specific site should be used to design drainage systems and select sump pumps.
5. Lowest point of water entry is defined as the joint between trench wall and trench bottom.
21. APPENDIX II - CLASSIFICATIONS FOR DIRECT BURIED SYSTEMS A. Groundwater conditions:
      1. Site Classification

## General

 Conditions for Such Classifications
   1. A - Severe
1. The water table is expected to be frequently above the bottom of the system and surface water is expected to accumulate and remain for long
   1. periods in the soil surrounding the system, or
2. The water table is expected to be occasionally above the bottom of the system and surface water is expected to accumulate and remain for long periods in the soil surrounding the system.
   1. B - Bad
1. The water table is expected to be occasionally above the bottom of the system and surface water is expected to accumulate and remain for short periods (or not at all) in the soil surrounding the system, or
2. The water table is expected never to be above the bottom of the system but surface water is expected to accumulate and remain for long periods in
   1. the soil surrounding the system.
   1. C - Moderate
   1. The water table is expected never to be above the bottom of the system but surface water is expected to accumulate and remain for short periods in the soil surrounding the system.
   1. D - Mild
   1. The water table is expected never to be above the bottom of the system and surface water is not expected to accumulate or remain in the soil surrounding the system.
1. System Temperature Classifications:
      1. High 261 to 450 deg F (127 to 232 deg C); Medium
   1. 201 to 260 deg F (94 to 126 deg C); Low 200 deg F (93 deg C) or lower.
2. Soil Conditions:
      1. Soil Corrosiveness Classification:
         1. The soil at the site should be classified as corrosive or noncorrosive on the basis of the following criteria:
2. Corrosive:
      1. The soil resistivity is less than 30,000 ohm-cm or stray direct currents can be detected underground.
3. Noncorrosive:
      1. The soil resistivity is 30,000 ohm-cm or greater and no stray direct currents can be detected underground.
4. The classification should be made by an experienced corrosion engineer based on a field survey of the site carried out in accordance with recognized guidelines for conducting such
   1. surveys.
   1. Soil pH:
      1. If there is any reason to suspect that the soil pH will be less than 5.0 anywhere along the proposed path of the system, pH measurements should be made at pipeline depth at close intervals along the proposed route, and all locations at which the pH is less than 5.0 should be indicated in the contract documents. An experienced soils engineer, preferably the same engineer responsible for other soil engineering work, should determine soil pH.
2. Type of Underground System Allowed:
      1. Drainable-Dryable-Testable (DDT) shall be allowed for Site Classifications A, B, C, D.
