      1. Future section to be added, contact City Engineer for details when preparing specification.
   1. WASHED ROCK:
      1. Angular or rounded, ¼ to 1½ inch, graded stone or acceptable local minerals such as coral, slag, cinders, crushed stone and crushed shells.

## Execution

   1. CULVERT INSTALLATION
   1. Excavation:
      1. Trenches shall be excavated to a width sufficient to allow for proper jointing of the culvert and thorough compaction of the bedding and backfill under and around the culvert.
   1. Preparation of Pipe:
      1. Inspect all pipe and fittings before lowering into the prepared trench to ensure that no cracked, broken, or defective pipe or fittings are being used in the work. Remove any foreign matter and soil from inside the pipe.
   1. Handing:
      1. Provide and use proper methods, tools, and facilities for the safe and proper protection of the work. Lower all pipe into the trench in such a manner as to avoid any physical damage to the pipe. Reject all damaged pipe and removed from the jobsite.
   1. Lines and Grades:
      1. Pipe shall be laid to the lines, grades, and elevations shown on the Plans. Storm sewer and lateral drain line pipe shall be sloped uniformly in accordance with the Plans to allow for continuous gravity drainage.
   1. Installation of Pipe and Fittings:
      1. Pipe and fittings shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Project Engineer’s approval of the pipe installation shall be required prior to backfilling the pipe zone.
   1. Culvert Placement:
      1. Unperforated culverts:
         1. All culverts shall be installed on a smooth and uniform foundation. Abrupt changes from hard to soft foundation should be avoided. A minimum of 6 inches of well-graded, granular material is to be placed beneath any pipe installed on a soft foundation. Hard or rock foundations are to be over-excavated a minimum of 6 inches and a well-graded, granular backfill or other suitable material installed to the proper grade and to the required density. All culvert installations are to be made in dewatered conditions.
   1. Perforated culverts/underdrains:
      1. All culverts shall be perforated as specified above. Prior to culvert placement, a drainage fabric shall be laid in the trench to separate the washed rock from the trench bottom and walls. See Geotextiles, Section 2242. The fabric shall be of adequate width to cover the top of the washed rock with a 2 foot overlap. A minimum of 4 inches of washed rock is to be placed beneath the culvert.
   1. Connections
   1. Concrete pipe:
      1. Concrete pipe sections shall be joined in such a manner that the ends are fully entered and the inner surfaces are reasonably flush and even. Joints shall be made with pipe joint sealing compound unless otherwise directed by the Project Engineer.
   1. Corrugated metal pipe:
      1. All connections shall be made with the properly sized band as supplied by the manufacturer.
   1. Connections of drainage laterals into storm sewer mains shall be made using rubber gasketed saddles or fittings oriented to allow the lateral to introduce flows into the main at the invert elevation specified on the plans.
   1. Jointing shall be made using standard of the industry water-tight gasketted joints.
   1. All steel couping bands and connection hardware shall be galvanized or aluminum coated to prevent galvanic action when unlike materials are connected.
   1. Where aluminum drainage pipe is to be in contact with steel structures or components, contact areas shall be given a heavy bituminous coating, inside and out, for a distance of 12 inches beyond the contact, or bituminous-coated coupling bands shall be used.
   1. Backfill
   1. Unless otherwise specified, backfill requirements shall be per Section 2221, Trenching, Bedding, and Backfill.
   1. Unperforated culverts:
      1. Backfill material should preferably be granular; however, cohesive-type material can also be used if careful attention is given to compaction at or very near optimum moisture content. All backfill material is to be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density.
   1. Backfill around the pipe and under the haunches shall be placed alternately in 6-inch lifts. The elevation of the backfill on either side of the pipe is to be kept nearly equal at all times during the backfilling process. For the installation of the pipe arches, the material beneath the corners is to be compacted to 100 percent maximum density. Mechanical compaction is to be done by means approved by the Project Engineer. Hydraulic backfilling will not be permitted.
   1. For pipe arches, the backfill is to be placed around and over the structure in uniform layers, conforming to the slope of the arch and thoroughly compacted. The material is to be placed from the top of the arch. When backfilling arches without headwalls, the first fill is to be placed midway between the ends of the arch.
   1. Perforated culverts/underdrains:
      1. The culvert shall be backfilled with washed rock to minimum of 4 inches above the culvert. The washed tock shall be covered with the drainage fabric. Backfill above the fabric shall consist of suitable native material. If suitable native material is not available, pit run shall be imported for backfill. The washed rock placed shall be compacted with a vibratory plate. Other backfill material shall be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density.
   1. Paved areas:
      1. In existing pavement areas, allowance shall be made for the pavement repair section.
