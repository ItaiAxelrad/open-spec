## Execution

   1. EARTHWORK
   1. Excavation, trenching, and backfilling are specified in Division 31 Section "Earth Moving."

	1. TRENCHING
   1. Obtain Owner’s Representative's approval of trench line and depth prior to placing bedding material or pipe.
3. BEDDING
   1. Dewater excavation, as necessary, to allow placement of culvert bedding in dry condition
   1. Place minimum thickness of 200 mm of approved granular material on bottom of excavation and compact to minimum 95% of corrected maximum dry density.
   1. Shape bedding to fit lower segment of pipe exterior so that width of at least 50% of pipe diameter is in close contact with bedding and to camber as indicated or as directed by Owner’s Representative, free from sags or high points.
   1. Place bedding in unfrozen condition.
4. INSTALLATION
   1. All pipe shall be carefully laid true to lines and grades indicated. Any pipe which is not in true alignment or which shows undue settlement after laying shall be taken up and re-laid at the Contractor's expense.
   1. Corrugated Metal Pipe:
      1. Commence pipe placing at downstream end.
   1. Ensure bottom of pipe is in contact with shaped bed or compacted fill throughout its length.
   1. Lay pipe with outside circumferential laps facing upstream and longitudinal laps or seams at side or quarter points.
   1. Lay paved invert or partially lined pipe with longitudinal center line of paved segment coinciding with flow line.
   1. Do not allow water to flow through pipes during construction except as permitted by Owner’s Representative.
   1. Install to conform with manufacturer’s recommendations.
   1. Lift or roll pipe to protect coating. Do not drag over gravel or rock. Avoid striking rocks or hard objects when lowering into trench.
   1. Pipe on which coatings have been damaged may be rejected at the site of the Work regardless of previous approvals.
   1. Join pipe sections with firmly bolted coupling bands of the same material as the pipe.
5. BACKFILLING
   1. Backfill around and over culverts as indicated or as directed by Owner’s Representative.
   1. Place granular backfill material backfill material, approved by Owner’s Representative, in 150 mm layers to full width, alternately on each side of culvert, so as not to displace it laterally or vertically.
   1. Compact each layer to 95% corrected maximum dry density maximum density to ASTM D698 taking special care to obtain required density under haunches.
   1. Protect installed culvert with minimum 600 mm cover of compacted fill before heavy equipment is permitted to cross. During construction, width of fill, at its top, to be at least twice diameter or span of pipe and with slopes not steeper than 1:2.
   1. Place backfill in unfrozen condition.
6. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Inspect interior of piping to determine whether line displacement or other damage has occurred. Geotechnical Engineer to inspect after approximately 24 inches of backfill is in place, and again at completion of Project.
   1. Submit separate reports for each system inspection.
   1. Defects requiring correction include the following:
      1. Alignment:
         1. Less than full diameter of inside of pipe is visible between structures.
   1. Deflection:
      1. Flexible piping with deflection that prevents passage of ball or cylinder of size not less than 92.5 percent of piping diameter.
   1. Damage:
      1. Crushed, broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged piping.
   1. Infiltration:
      1. Water leakage into piping.
   1. Exfiltration:
      1. Water leakage from or around piping.
   1. Replace defective piping using new materials, and repeat inspections until defects are within allowances specified.
   1. Reinspect and repeat procedure until results are satisfactory.
   1. Test new piping systems, and parts of existing systems that have been altered, extended, or repaired, for leaks and defects.
   1. Do not enclose, cover, or put into service before inspection and approval.
   1. Test completed piping systems according to requirements of authorities having jurisdiction.
   1. Schedule tests and inspections by authorities having jurisdiction with at least 24 hours' advance notice.
   1. Submit separate report for each test.
   1. Leaks and loss in test pressure constitute defects that must be repaired.
   1. Replace leaking piping using new materials, and repeat testing until leakage is within allowances specified.

	1. CLEANING
   1. Clean interior of piping of dirt and superfluous materials.Flush with water.
