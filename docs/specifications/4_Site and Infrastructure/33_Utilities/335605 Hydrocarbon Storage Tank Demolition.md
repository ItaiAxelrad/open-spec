1. CONTAMINATED SITE
   1. If obvious contamination exists, the contractor shall **immediately** notify the Project Representative. If free product, heavily saturated soils, or other conditions dictate that a remedial investigation and extensive corrective actions will be needed for clean closure, the soil sampling and lab testing may not be completed, and the excavation shall be protected by backfilling filling with clean soil or providing a temporary barricade as directed by the Project Representative.
   1. The Base Bid will be adjusted for the addition or reduction in scope of work resulting from a contaminated site, including the omission of soil samples and lab tests, the omission of backfill, and/or the addition of a temporary barricade.
   1. If the contamination is judged as minimal based on observations and field screening, the Project Engineer may direct the contractor to proceed with over‑excavation, up to a maximum of 30 cubic yards, to achieve a clean closure. Excavation and stockpiling of contaminated soils may be governed by OSHA "Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard 1910.12".
   1. Contaminated soil from over‑excavation shall be combined with that from tank removal and stockpiled on site in a location designated by the property owner. Stock pile shall be placed on an impervious surface and covered with an impervious membrane securely fastened in place.

   1. After fill placement and compaction grade surface to meet adjacent contours and to provide flow to surface drainage structures.
1. SITE RESTORATION/CLEANUP
1. *(Note to Designer:
      1. Site restoration may be covered by other related sections of this specification and paving may be required as part of Base Bid rather than being optional. Also see Specification Section 02500 - Paving and Surfacing that may be used if needed, or appropriate provisions from Section 02500 may be added to this article. Edit the following to reflect actual site restoration requirements of the project.)*
   1. Surface restoration in tank excavation area shall consist of the placement of least four inches of top soil in non‑paved areas and crushed gravel base course in paved areas. Crushed gravel must be mechanically compacted to eight inches depth. Finish grades must conform with surrounding area.
   1. The Contractor is responsible for repairing all site damage outside the tank excavation area as directed by the Project Representative.
