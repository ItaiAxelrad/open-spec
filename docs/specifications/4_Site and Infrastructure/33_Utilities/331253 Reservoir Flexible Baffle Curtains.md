## Execution

01. COORDINATION
   1. The baffle manufacturer shall coordinate with the Engineer and the tank manufacturer concerning loading on the reservoir, attachment details, and the sequence of construction. Installation details are shown on the plans are provided as a guide for the contractor and baffle manufacturer.
2. The tank contractor shall provide thickened areas beneath the membrane slab as required for securing the base of the baffle walls.
02. PREPARATION AND FABRICATION
   1. Prior to factory seaming, all roll goods shall be inspected. All factory seams shall be made by thermal fusion methods. All factory seams shall have a minimum scrim-to-scrim overlap of one and one-half inches (1-1/2”) when fabricated. Fabricated seams found to have less than the specified minimum overlap shall be repaired by adding an overlap or cap strip that provides the minimum specified overlap or will be rejected. All seams shall be made so that thermal fusion bond extends fully along the width of the sheet so that no loose edges are present.
2. Prior to installation, all unnecessary material and equipment shall be removed from the tank and the floor slab installation areas shall be swept clean.
	1. INSPECTION
3. All sheets and seams shall be 100% visually inspected during fabrication. No defective seams or exposed scrim will be allowed. All exposed scrim edges shall be sealed with an approved polypropylene edge sealant or capped with a strip of unreinforced polypropylene. All indicated repairs shall be made by the geomembrane fabricator before the panels are packaged for shipment.
4. In addition to visual inspection, a 48-inch (1.2m) weld sample shall be made with each factory seam welding unit used in this work at the beginning of every work shift and every four hours of production thereafter. Sample shall be taken from a seam specifically made for quality testing and not taken from the fabricated panel itself. Test specimens shall be cut at quarter points from each 48-inch seam sample (a total of three places) and tested for seam strength and peel adhesion. The shear seam strength shall be tested in accordance with ASTM D751 as modified in Annex A of ANSI/NSF 54. The peel adhesion shall be tested in accordance with ASTM D 4437 as modified in Annex A of ANSI/NSF 54.
	1. A log shall be maintained showing the date, time, panel number and test results. Failure of the material and/or seams to meet all the requirements of these specifications may be cause for rejection of the material and/or seams as appropriate. The Fabricator shall provide the test results to the Owner or Engineer upon request.
	2. Upon completion of baffle wall installation, contractor shall visually inspect the baffle walls for damage from ground level. Any repairs shall be made with newly manufactured material cut with rounded corners extending 4-inches in each direction from the damaged area. The entire repair shall be completely welded to the baffle wall.
	3. INSTALLATION
5. CONTRACTOR shall field verify dimensions and provide the field dimensions to the baffle curtain fabricator prior to fabrication of the baffle curtains.
6. All work shall be fabricated and erected in accordance with the approved submittal drawings. For those baffles requiring widths greater than the coated fabric available from the manufacturer, a thermal fusion heat seam nominal 2 inches wide shall be used at those locations to join multiple widths of fabric together. The strength of the seam shall be as great as or greater than the parent material in shear strength.
7. Baffle shall be secured to the floor and walls with type 316 Stainless Steel Angles with type 316 stainless steel expansion anchors. All baffle penetrations shall be punched. Provide 3/8-inch polypropylene rope in the 4” wide, double hem on the perimeter of the baffle curtain(s). The 3/8-inch polypropylene rope inside the 4” wide hem shall be behind the stainless-steel plates at floor and wall locations.
8. Provide stainless steel pipe and stainless-steel angle plates; or stainless-steel flat plates sandwiching the baffle curtain on the top edge and open end of the baffle wall with 3/8-inch bolts for attaching the baffle to the top and the open-end wall of the tank as shown on the drawings.
9. Provide stainless steel ¼” x 2” x 2” x 2” angle plates to be attached to the ceiling and the open-end wall of the tank for securing the type 316 stainless steel 3/16” diameter cable from the tank wall to the top edge or open end of the baffle curtain to tension or suspend the baffle curtain. The type 316 stainless steel 3/16” diameter cable shall be secured using type 316 stainless steel 3/16” cable clamps.
10. Hardware and fasteners shall be made of type 316 stainless steel.
