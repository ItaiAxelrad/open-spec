2. Apply the 10,400 lb load over the prescribed area centered on the cover. The load shall be transferred into the cover and test frame through a ½” thick piece of rubber backed by ten inch by ten inch by one-inch thick steel plate. A spherical bearing swivel head shall be used in the testing machine. The load shall be applied at a rate of 550 lb / second, +/- 450 lb / second. 
3. The Design Load (10,400 lb) shall be cycled on the cover in the test frame ten times as per WUC, Guide 3.6 test protocol. On the eleventh cycle, the load shall be increased to confirm the cover can sustain the Proof of Design Load (22,568 lb.). 
4. The failure criteria shall be determined by the one of the two following criteria. Yield – the point on a stress / strain curve where resistance to the applied load no longer increases as deflection continues. Break – the point where increasing load results in exceeding the tensile or elastic limit of a material.

## Execution

1. 3.01 EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL AROUND METER BOXES
   1. Perform excavation, backfill and compaction in accordance with Section 02223, Trenching, Excavation, Backfill, and Compacting. Compact each lift of structural backfill all around meter boxes placing next lift. 
2. Meter boxes in concrete or pavement for driveways, parking lots, alleys and off-road way applications subjected to occasional non deliberate heavy vehicles require an 8-inch wide concrete collar 10 inches deep around the top of the meter box. Refer to the Approved Plans.
1. 3.02 INSTALLING METER BOXES
   1. Set each precast concrete vault unit plumb and flush with existing surfaces and the water service piping shall be located 10-inches below the top of the meter box and shall be centered in the meter box.
2. Physical movement of existing meters and meter boxes to new locations may be required where service lines are transferred to new mains in conjunction with main replacement work. Unless specified otherwise, the Contractor shall move existing meters and meter boxes and reconnect and adjust customer's yard piping as part of transferring service lines.
3. All removed meter boxes and covers not to be reused and shall be disposed by the Contractor, except for steel box covers shall be salvaged and returned to the City. As The Contractor shall replace the removed meter boxes with the new and appropriate loading meter boxes per the Approved Material List. Unless otherwise specified, the old service line shall be removed per Section 02222 after the existing meter has been reset in the existing or new meter box. 
4. New meters will be set by the Contractor where mains are extended and new services lines are installed for new or initial customer service. In lieu of the new meter, the Contractor shall furnish and install a standard service connection per the Approved Plans. 
5. The meter and meter box configuration, shall have the meter set horizontal, approximately 8 inches below the top of meter box, so that the meter is above the bottom of the meter box and in-line with the meter box lid opening. The meter shall be centered within the meter box without any bends. The meter box shall also be placed to allow meter flange bolts and swivel nuts to be easily removed without obstructions. The top of the meter box shall be flush with the existing ground surface. All excess soil above the meter coupling, meter flange and meter nuts inside the meter box shall be removed so that the meter register is clearly visible. The Contractor shall exercise special precautions during excavation at the existing meter location in order to minimize the disturbance of the customer's yard piping. However, if the existing meter elevation is low, the Contractor shall raise the existing meter to conform to the correct configuration indicated herein. Adjustment of meter to proper grade is incidental to the construction and will not be paid for separately.
6. Prepare the meter box excavation approximately 6 inches deeper than the overall height of the meter box. The length and width of the excavation should be determined by adding 4 inches to 6 inches to the overall length and width of the meter box.
7. Place approximately 3 to 6 inches of compacted sand or gravel under the box. The compacted material should be leveled so the top of the meter box or pull box or superimposed cover is flush to grade
8. Backfilling meter boxes for non-vehicle traffic applications backfilling shall be as follows; Place selected backfill into you excavation at 12 inch lift and compact either by mechanical compacting or flooding the excavation to achieve the desired relative compaction, install with the cover in place
9. For construction in concrete pavement driveways parking lots alleys the following backfilling shall be recommended place selected backfilling to the excavation at 12 inch lift and compact either my mechanical compacting the backfill should be discontinued approximately 8 inches below finish grade the final 8 inches of excavation should be finished with concrete this should be accomplished by providing a form around the enclosure that would produce an 8 inch wide collar
