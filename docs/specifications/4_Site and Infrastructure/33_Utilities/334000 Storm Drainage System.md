	2. Quality Assurance
3. Work shall be per:
	1. American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
	2. Manufacturers Standardization Society of the Valve and Fittings Industry Inc. (MSS).
	3. Submittals
4. See Specification Section 01 33 00 for requirements for the mechanics and administration of the submittal process.
5. Shop Drawings shall include:
      1. 
	1. Product technical data including acknowledgement that products submitted meet requirements of standards referenced. 
	2. Certifications.
	3. Test report
		1. Flow test data from an accredited hydraulics laboratory to confirm pressure drop and hydraulic data.
## Product

	1. Materials
   1. Valves and Appurtenances:
	1. Check Valve:
		1. Acceptable Manufacturer:
			1. Red Valve, Checkmate.
		2. Design: 
			1. Check valves are to be all rubber and the flow operated check type with slip-in cuff connection. 
			2. Shall be ply reinforced throughout the body, saddle and bill, which shall be cured and vulcanized into a one-piece unibody construction. 
			3. A separate valve body or pipe is not acceptable.
			4. There shall be no metal, mechanical hinges or fasteners.
			5. The port area of the saddle shall contour into a circumferential sealing area that is concentric with the pipe which shall allow passage of flow in one direction and preventing flow in the reverse. 
			6. The entire valve shall fit within the pipe inside diameter.
			7. The saddle area shall be flat, not conical and integral with the rubber body above centerline in order to not product any areas that can trap debris.
			8. The valve shall incorporate multiple concave grooves molded integrally into the flat saddle wall thickness extending longitudinally a minimum of 80% of the length of the saddle to reduce opening resistance and reduce headloss. 
			9. The valve shall incorporate a custom shaped notch in the end of the bill to reduce cracking pressure. 
			10. The outside diameter must be in contact with the inside diameter of the pipe.
			11. Shall include stainless steel expansion clamps.
			1. Shall be installed in the upstream or downstream cuff of the valve
