    DESIGNER NOTE: The designer should adjust infiltration rates to reflect project specific conditions such as anticipated sediment loading based on pavement use (e.g., vehicular, pedestrian) and design run-on from adjacent surfaces. The recommended criteria are as follows: 1.  For porous asphalt that will accept run-on from adjacent impervious and/or pervious surfaces OR pavement that will be subject to vehicular traffic: 1. o The average of all surface infiltration tests shall be greater than 200 inches per hour with no single test less than 100 inches per hour

 For porous asphalt not subject to run-on OR vehicular traffic: 1. o The average of all surface infiltration tests shall be greater than 100 inches per hour with no single test less than 50 inches per hour 1. Infiltration Visual Testing: 1. Visual flood testing of the surface shall be conducted by application of clean water at the rate of at least
5 gpm over the surface, using a hose or other distribution devise. Water used for the test shall be clean, free of suspended solids and deleterious liquids and will be provided at no extra cost to the Owner. All applied water shall infiltrate directly without large puddle formation or surface runoff, and shall be observed by the

1. February 2016 32 12 43 - 10
1. DIVISION 32 – EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS Section 32 12 43 – Porous Asphalt Concrete
   1. Engineer. The Engineer shall mark areas where large puddles form in the field. Areas with slow infiltration shall not exceed
   1. 10 percent of the total surface.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Smoothness specification should be revised as needed to reflect project design objectives (e.g., smoothness specifications from Section 212 of the City Streets and Highways specifications).
1. 5.\*\* Smoothness:
   1. Porous asphalt smoothness shall be checked with a
   1. 10-foot straightedge. Vertical measurement shall be taken between the pavement’s determined plane and straight edge in a direction perpendicular and parallel to the centerline. The finished pavement shall be uniform to a degree such that no variations greater than
   1. 3/8-inch are present between the straightedge and pavement surface.
1. 6.\*\* Grade:
   1. Porous asphalt shall be true to designed spot elevations plus or minus ½ inch and shall not deviate from designed slope more than
   1. ¼ inch in ten (10) feet. Where abutting existing facilities such as sidewalks, walkways, curbs, driveways or other pavements, the porous asphalt shall be flush.
1. 7.\*\* Line:
   1. Porous asphalt margins shall be true to designed lines plus or minus ½ inch at any point.
1. 8.\*\* Slope:
   1. Porous asphalt shall be sloped as shown on the Plans. Slope shall be consistent to within 1/4 inch in ten (10) feet.
1. 9.\*\* Thickness:
   1. Each core sample shall be equal to the minimum section depth or more as specified on the Plans.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Revise the load slip specification as needed to align with the measurement and payment specifications.
1. 10.\*\* Load Slip:
   1. Each load of porous asphalt transported to the location of placement shall have a load slip delivered with the load that is certified by a licensed weightmaster and includes the combined mixture weight.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Designer should specify consequences of any failed acceptance tests (e.g., reduced payment for lower infiltration rate and lower percent voids, reduced payment for failed smoothness tests) or if consequences are full replacement.
1. 11.\*\* Reduced Payment Factors:
   1. The reduced payment factors in Caltrans
   1. Standard Specification 39-2.03A (Testing) do not apply.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. The following table is a Sample Owner Quality Assurance Sampling and Testing Plan is provided to illustrate the type and frequency of testing that may be required. Frequency and standard for all tests should be project specific.

## Execution

1.  1.  SUBGRADE PREPARATION AND PROTECTION
    1.  Construct subgrade to +/- ¾ inch of the grades and slopes specified on the
        Plans.
    1.  Grading of subgrade shall be with low ground pressure equipment when within six (6) inches of final subgrade elevation.
    1.  Compact subgrade to 90 percent (+/- 2 percent) of the maximum dry density per standard Proctor test (ASTM D698), or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer. Determination of in-place density shall be made using a nuclear gauge per ASTM D6939.
        DESIGNER NOTE: The designer should set compaction requirements based on consideration of site specific geotechnical properties of the native soil (e.g., permeability, stiffness) and performance requirements for the pavement section (e.g., traffic loading, infiltration, cost).
    1.  Areas of the subgrade which are over-compacted, as determined by the Geotechnical Engineer, shall be ripped/tilled to a depth of 12 inches (minimum) or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer, and shall be recompacted in accordance with 3.01.C. Contractor shall locate all utilities within pavement footprint prior to ripping and re-compacting subgrade
    1.  Proof-roll prepared subgrade with loaded dump truck, remove soft spots, and replace with permeable structural fill as directed by the Engineer to achieve uniform subgrade.
    1.  After compaction and proof roll, scarify subgrade ¼ to ½ inch deep by hand rake. Once scarified, materials or equipment shall not be permitted within the prepared subgrade area so as to avoid recompaction or clogging of the scarified subgrade.
    1.  The subgrade shall be protected from over-compaction or contamination by silty run-off or other contaminants.

The first two (2) passes (minimum) shall be in vibratory mode. The final pass shall be in static mode. Acceptance of the pavement base will be based on Engineer’s observation of aggregate movement during final compaction pass. Compaction equipment shall be accepted by the Engineer prior to use.
        DESIGNER NOTE: For areas or sites that cannot accommodate a vibratory roller compactor, consider allowing compaction of pavement base with a
    1.  13,500 lbf (60 kN) minimum vibratory plate compactor with a compaction
1.  February 2016 32 12 43 - 17
1.  DIVISION 32 – EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS Section 32 12 43 – Porous Asphalt Concrete 1. At least two passes should be made over each lift of the aggregates.
    1.  Pavement base shall be true to the designed grade and slope, +/- 0.05 feet, after compaction for each layer. In the event of low spots additional material shall be added and recompacted. In the event of high spots, excess material shall be removed and the area recompacted.
    1.  The pavement base shall be protected from over-compaction or contamination by silty run-off or other contaminants.

    DESIGNER NOTE: The compaction could be established by the contractor rather than prescribed below depending on whether the contracting agency prefers to take a prescriptive approach or performance based approach. Prescriptive is used here because full depth porous asphalt is an emerging technology and there are limited density specifications for open graded (porous) asphalt mixtures. But care must be taken to ensure this prescriptive specification is compatible with the acceptance criteria.
1.  Spreading and Compacting:
    The type of rollers to be used and their relative position in the compaction sequence shall be dictated by the contractor provided the requirements below are met and the completed porous asphalt meets the required quality characteristics specified in Section 1.05. Deviation from the requirements below must be approved in advance by the Engineer.
    1.\*\* The porous asphalt shall be laid in lifts of up to 4 inches in thickness using approved equipment to achieve the total thickness indicated in the Plans.
1.  DESIGNER NOTE:
    1. Designer should consider using thinner lifts to the extent practical to ensure better compaction.
1.  2.\*\* The temperature of the Porous HMA mix during laying, breakdown rolling, and finished rolling, shall be within the supplier-recommended temperature range.
1.  3.\*\* Breakdown rolling shall be performed with one or two passes of a
    5.- to 10-ton vibratory roller operated in low amplitude mode when the mix temperature is within the supplier-recommended temperature range.
1.  4.\*\* Finished rolling shall be performed with a double-drum finish roller operated in static mode when the mix temperature is within the supplier-recommended temperature range.

1.  6.\*\* The Contractor shall take care to insure that the porous asphalt lifts join completely to previous lifts. The Contractor shall keep the time between lift placements to a minimum, keeping the surface of the previous lift clear from dust and moisture between lifts, and restrict traffic from initial lifts until the full depth of asphalt pavement has been placed.
1.  7.\*\* Sufficient time shall be allowed between lifts to allow the asphalt to set and cool to at or below the supplier recommended maximum temperature for placement of subsequent lifts.
1.  1.  OPENING TO TRAFFIC
    1.  After final rolling, no vehicular traffic of any kind shall be permitted on the pavement surface until cooling and hardening has taken place, and in no case within the first six (6) hours. Provide traffic control measures as necessary to prevent vehicular use and remove when no longer required.
1.  1.  PROTECTION OF PAVEMENT
    1.  Hardened porous asphalt pavement surface shall be kept clean and free of clogging debris and soils from the Contractor’s operations and all upstream and adjacent debris. If debris or soils contaminate the porous pavement voids, the pavement shall be cleaned at the Contractor’s expense and to the satisfaction of the Engineer. If porous asphalt pavement cannot be unclogged, it shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
1.  1.  REJECTION
    1.  Porous asphalt that does not meet the acceptance criteria set forth in Section 1.05.E will be rejected by the Engineer. Porous asphalt that has been rejected by the Engineer shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense.
