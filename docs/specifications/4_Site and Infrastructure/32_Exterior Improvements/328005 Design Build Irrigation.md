      1. Water supply shall be extended from water supply lines.
  1.  FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
  1.  Flushing
  1.  After piping, risers, and valves are in place and connected, but prior to installation of sprinkler heads, quick coupler assemblies, and hose valves, thoroughly flush piping system under full head of water pressure from dead end fittings. Maintain flushing for 5 minutes through furthermost valves. Cap risers after flushing.
  1.  Testing
  1.  Conduct tests in presence of Owners Representative. Arrange for presence of Owner’s Representative 48 hours in advance of testing. Contractor shall supply force pump and all other test equipment.
  1.  After backfilling, and installation of all control valves, fill pressure supply line with water, and pressurize to 40 PSI over the designated static pressure or 120 PSI, whichever is greater, for a period of 2 hours.
  1.  Leakage, Pressure Loss - Test is acceptable if no more than 2 pounds of pressure loss is evident during the test period.
  1.  Leaks - Detect and repair leaks.
  1.  Retest system until test pressure can be maintained for duration of test.
  1.  Before final acceptance, pressure supply line shall remain under pressure for a period of 48 hours.
