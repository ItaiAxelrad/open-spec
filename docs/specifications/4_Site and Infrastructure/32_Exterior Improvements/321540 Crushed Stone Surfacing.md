## Execution

   1. DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING
   1. Crusher fines shall be stockpiled at designated sites as approved by the Owner's Representative to minimize disturbances to existing vegetation. Care should be taken not to mix crusher fines with soil. Material that is mixed with soil will not be acceptable and shall be removed from the site immediately.
1. INSTALLATION OF CRUSHER FINES PAVEMENT
   1. Prepare subgrade to the lines, grade, compaction and depth as designated on the plans.
   1. Install weed barrier in the manner and locations shown on the drawings.
   1. Areas on which weed barrier is to be placed shall have uniform slope, be reasonably smooth, and free from mounds and windows, and free of any debris or projections which could damage the material.
   1. The material shall be loosely laid, not stretched. Adjacent strips shall overlap by a minimum of 18 inches. The material shall be anchored in place with securing pins at three-foot spacing along, but not closer than, two inches from each edge and at other locations to the extent necessary to prevent displacement.
   1. Replace or repair damaged or displaced weed barrier before or during placement of crusher fines to the satisfaction of the Owner's Representative, without additional cost to the Owner.
   1. Protect weed barrier from sunlight prior to installation. material shall not be exposed to direct sunlight for more than two weeks.
   1. Spread thoroughly mixed portions of crusher fines mix uniformly over fabric. No portion of the fabric shall be exposed.
   1. Rake crusher fines mix to uniform depth with 2% cross slope.
   1. Backfill excavation to ultimate trail edge with scraper spoils, using backfill to hold edge of crusher fines mix in place.
   1. Water the crusher fines mix thoroughly before compacting.
   1. Immediately compact crusher fines mix into smooth firm surface with self-propelled, vibratory roller of sufficient weight. Rolling shall continue until all material is firmly locked and keyed together. Apply additional water as needed. The appearance and surface shall be uniform with all ridges removed. Surface shall not vary more than 1/2" when measured with a ten foot straight edge applied parallel to the centerline. Correct any variation by loosening, reshaping, and re-rolling. When finished, compacted trail shall be a minimum of 8" deep in all locations.
   1. In any areas where there are underground pipes, use extreme caution when compacting trail to protect pipe. Discuss alternative compaction methods with Owner's Representative prior to execution for approval if pipe hazard is anticipated.
   1. At completion of surfacing, remove excess spoils from along trail edge and deposit on site as directed by Owner's Representative.
   1. Rake along all trail edges to ensure finished appearance and positive drainage away from trail and into new drainage structures; alter grade if necessary.
   1. Cleaning
	1. General:
      1. Contractor shall be responsible for daily removal of mud and debris from road surfaces on a daily basis. Legally dispose of debris and excess materials off-site.
   1. No separate payment will be made for cleaning and all costs connected therein shall be considered incidental to the contract.
   1. Protection
   1. The Contractor shall be responsible for making a reasonable effort to protect the work from vandalism. If barricading or signage is necessary, the Contractor shall request such from the Owner. Owner shall provide any necessary barricading or signage. Any vandalism shall be repaired by the contractor until substantial completion is granted.
