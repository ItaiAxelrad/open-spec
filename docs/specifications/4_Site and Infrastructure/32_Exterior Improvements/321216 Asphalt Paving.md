## Product

1. Materials
   1. Base Course:
      1. Class 6 Aggregate Base Course per Section 703 of the Standard Specifications.
2. Surface Course:
   1. Bituminous pavement shall meet the requirements of Sections 401.01 to 401.06 of the Standard Specifications, 5/8 inch mix made with 6 percent of AC-10
3. Prime and Tack Coat

## Execution

1. Protection of Existing Pavement
   1. The pavement adjacent to an excavation shall be protected from damage caused by movement of construction equipment or other work. Any paved surface damaged due to the Contractorâ€™s negligence, shall be replaced or repaired at no expense to the Owner. The area to be replaced or repaired shall be as designated by the Engineer.
1. Cutting and Removal
   1. Pavement shall be neatly cut along the lines shown on the Drawings or as approved in the field by the Engineer. Pavement shall be cut by saw, or other approved method.
1. Care shall be exercised so that adjacent pavement outside the cut will not be disturbed or damaged. Excavated pavement shall be removed and disposed of off-site. Removed pavement may not be used as trench backfill.
1. Temporary Pavement
   1. If bituminous pavement is not replaced within 24 hours following backfill completion, the Contractor shall install additional base course to match the existing traveled surface. The Contractor shall maintain the traveled surface as necessary to keep it smooth, free from soft spots and dust free. Just prior to bituminous pavement replacement, the Contractor shall remove and dispose of the additional base course.
   1. Bituminous Pavement Replacement
1. Prior to installation of bituminous pavement, cut and remove additional pavement to provide a clean, straight and uniform line without sharp jogs. The edge of the existing pavement shall be cut back so that at least one foot of bituminous pavement will be placed upon undisturbed material outside of the actual trench excavation area on each side of the trench.
1. Prime and tack coat shall be applied over finished surface of base course and over existing bituminous pavements prior to laying hot mix asphalt.
   1. Quality Control
1. The degree of compaction specified for non-bituminous material shall be 95-percent of maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D 1557.
1. The moisture content of non-bituminous material shall be within 2.0 percent of optimum moisture as determined by ASTM D 1557
1. Periodic compaction tests shall be performed by the Engineer to determine if the requirements of this section are being met. The Contractor may wish to conduct additional compaction tests to monitor the installation procedure and assure the quality of the Work. Compaction tests by the Engineer will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for the Work performed.
