   1. Bluegrass sod and irrigated bluegrass seed area amendments
   1. Thoroughly mix the following amendments tilled to a depth of six inches.
   1. Specified Compost 3.0 c.y. per 1,000 s.f.
   1. Naturalized seed areas
   1. All seed areas shall receive “Biosol 6-1-3” organic fertilizer at the time of seeding at a rate of 1,000 pounds per acre. If soils test identify more or less fertilizer required, the contractor will be expected to submit a change order to adjust the contract price for a credit or overage. 
   1. Specified Compost 3.0 c.y. per 1,000 s.f.

   1. source quality control
   1. Verification of Performance
   1. Compost and other soil amendments are typically identified by a rate of cubic yards per 1000 s.f. In order to accurately determine if amendments are applied at the correct rate, the following chart is supplied. This chart is intended to verify the cubic yards by allowing a method for measuring the depth of the material spread uniformly across the surface of the planting area, with no exposed soil, prior to mixing the amendments with the existing soils. 
   1. This method will be used during inspections to verify that adequate amendments are incorporated into the soil.

   1. An inspection of soil preparation will be performed by the Owner’s Representative before areas will be released for planting. The inspection shall consist taking a soil sample to determine
   1. Proper tilling of the soil. Soil will be judged on how easily a soil probe can be inserted into the ground.
   1. Proper depth of tilling, and homogeneity of the soil. The soil sample will be judged on uniformity of the soil profile in the top six to eight inches.
   1. A visual inspection for adequate compost will be conducted. An area that has similar soil structures, that has not received compost will be used as the basis of comparison. Should a disagreement exist, multiple soil samples will be sent to an independent testing laboratory to determine the amount of organic matter present. The cost of this testing will be absorbed by the Owner’s Representative.
