4. APPLICATION
1. General
1. Following preparation and subsequent inspection of the surface, the bituminous coat shall be applied at the specified rate with uniform distribution over the surface to be treated. All areas and spots missed by the distributor shall be properly treated with the hand spray. Until the succeeding layer of pavement is placed, the surface shall be maintained by protecting the surface against damage and by repairing deficient areas at no additional cost to the Owner. If required, clean dry sand shall be spread to effectively blot up any excess bituminous material. No smoking, fires, or flames other than those from the heaters that are a part of the equipment shall be permitted within 25 feet of heating, distributing, and transferring operations of bituminous material other than bituminous emulsions. All traffic, except for paving equipment used in constructing the surfacing, shall be prevented from using the underlying material, whether primed or not, until the surfacing is completed. The bituminous coat shall conform to all requirements as described herein.
   1. Prime Coat
1. The prime coat shall be required if it shall be at least seven days before the surfacing (Asphalt cement hot mix concrete)layer is constructed on the underlying (base course, etc) compacted material. The type of liquid asphalt and application rate shall be as specified herein. The Contractor shall protect the underlying from any damage (water, traffic, etc.) until the surfacing is placed. If the Contractor places the surfacing within seven days, the choice of protection measures or actions to be taken shall be at the Contractor's option. Damage to the underlying material caused by lack of, or inadequate, protection shall be repaired (recompacted or replaced) by approved methods at no additional cost to the Owner. If the Contractor options to use the prime coat, it shall be applied as soon as possible after consolidation of the underlying material. To obtain uniform application of the prime coat on the surface treated at the junction of previous and subsequent applications, building paper shall be spread on the surface for a sufficient distance back from the ends of each application to start and stop the prime coat on the paper. Immediately after application, the building paper shall be removed and destroyed.
   1. Tack Coat
1. Apply tack coat at the locations shown on the drawings. Apply the tack coat when the surface to be treated is dry. Immediately following the preparation of the surface for treatment, apply the bituminous material by means of the bituminous distributor, within the limits of temperature specified herein and at a rate of not less than 0.05 gallon nor more than 0.15 gallon of diluted emulsion per square yard. Apply the bituminous material so that uniform distribution is obtained over the entire surface to be treated. Treat lightly coated areas and spots missed by the distributor with the bituminous material. Following the application of bituminous material, allow the surface to cure without being disturbed for period of time necessary to permit setting of the tack coat. Apply the bituminous tack coat only as far in advance of the placing of the overlying layer as required for that day's operation. Maintain and protect the treated surface from damage until the succeeding course of pavement shall be placed.
1. CURING PERIOD
   1. Following application of the bituminous material and prior to application of the succeeding layer of pavement, the bituminous coat shall be allowed to cure and to obtain evaporation of any volatiles or moisture. Maintain the coated surface until the succeeding layer of pavement is placed, by protecting the surface against damage and by repairing and recoating deficient areas. Prime coat shall be allowed to cure without being disturbed for a period of at least 48 hours or longer, as may be necessary to attain penetration into the treated course.
1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Samples of the bituminous material shall be tested for compliance with the applicable specified requirements. A sample shall be obtained and tested for density ASTM D 1188, ASTM D 2726, or ASTM D 2950 thickness, ASTM 3549 and air voids ASTM D 3203 by the Contractor for every 300 tons of bituminous material used shall be obtained by the Contractor as directed, under the supervision of the Owner. A sample shall be obtained and tested for asphalt content ASTM D 2172 and aggregate gradation by the Contractor for every 1500 tons of bituminous material used, under the supervision of the Owner.
1. SAMPLING AND TESTING
   1. Sampling and testing shall be performed by an approved commercial testing laboratory or by facilities furnished by the Contractor. No work requiring testing shall be permitted until the facilities have been inspected and approved.
   1. Sampling
1. The samples of bituminous material, unless otherwise specified, shall be in accordance with ASTM D 140 or AASHTO T 40. Sources from which bituminous materials are to be obtained shall be selected and notification furnished the Owner within 15 days after the award of the contract.
   1. Calibration Test
1. The Contractor shall furnish all equipment, materials, and labor necessary to calibrate the bituminous distributor. Calibration shall be made with the approved job material and prior to applying the bituminous coat material to the prepared surface. Calibration of the bituminous distributor shall be in accordance with ASTM D 2995.
   1. Trial Applications
1. Before providing the complete bituminous coat, three lengths of at least 100 feet for the full width of the distributor bar shall be applied to evaluate the amount of bituminous material that can be satisfactorily applied.
1. Tack Coat Trial Application Rate
   1. Unless otherwise authorized, the trial application rate of bituminous tack coat materials shall be applied in the amount of 0.05 gallons per square yard. Other trial applications shall be made using various amounts of material as may be deemed necessary.
1. Prime Coat Trial Application Rate
   1. Unless otherwise authorized, the trial application rate of bituminous materials shall be applied in the amount of 0.25 gallon per square yard. Other trial applications shall be made using various amounts of material as may be deemed necessary.
   1. Sampling and Testing During Construction
1. Quality control sampling and testing shall be performed as required in paragraph FIELD QUALITY CONTROL.
1. TRAFFIC CONTROLS
   1. Keep traffic off surfaces freshly treated with bituminous material. Sufficient warning signs and barricades shall be provided so that traffic shall not travel over freshly treated surfaces.
