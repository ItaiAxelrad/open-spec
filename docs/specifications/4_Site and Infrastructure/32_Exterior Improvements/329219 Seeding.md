   1. Performance Requirements
   1. Irrigated Seed Areas
   1. This includes all areas with in the limits of work that are recently planted and irrigated. Contractor should monitor these areas on a regular basis for the presence of weeds. Areas will require individual attention and separate maintenance schedules, thus the contractor is responsible for developing and sustaining a weed-free, lush stand of specified grasses. Chemical, mechanical, or manual methods should be implemented to prevent the spread of weeds. Mowing is the preferred method to help establish newly seeded areas. Contractor will be expected to re-seed or over-seed areas as bare spots develop. Bare spots should not exceed 8 inches square by the end of the first full growing season.
   1. Non-irrigated Seeded Areas
   1. This includes all areas with in the limits of work that are recently seeded, and do not receive supplemental watering. Contractor should monitor these areas on a regular basis for the presence of weeds. Areas will require individual attention and separate maintenance schedules, thus the contractor is responsible for developing and sustaining a weed-free, lush stand of dryland grasses. Chemical, mechanical, or manual methods should be implemented to prevent the spread of weeds. Mowing is the preferred method to help establish newly seeded areas. Contractor will be expected to re-seed or over-seed areas as bare spots develop. Bare spots should not exceed 12 inches square by the end of the first full growing season.
   1. Bidders shall assume that all seed areas will require an initial seeding and a second overseeding. The second seeding may be drill seeded or overseeded depending on the amount of coverage achieved in the first attempt at seeding. 
   1. Seeding shall generally be completed in spring and fall. It may be necessary to alter the production schedule or installation practices to ensure the majority of the seed is installed at the optimal time. For instance it may be necessary to eradicate weeds and seed prior to installing irrigation. Then install irrigation and repair the limited areas where lines were installed.
   1. If seeding occurred in the early fall/late summer, it may be required to perform the second seeding during the following landscape season. The second seeding shall not be a condition of initial acceptance, but will be required when reviewing the performance of areas as part of the warranty and final inspections.
1. SUBMITTALS
   1. Refer to submittals in General Landscape Section.
   1. PROJECT/SITE CONDITIONS
   1. Existing Conditions
   1. Vehicular accessibility on site shall be as directed by Owner’s representative. Repair damage to prepared ground and surfaces caused by vehicular movement during work under this section to original condition at no additional cost to Owner.
   1. Environmental Conditions
   1. Do not drill or sow seed during windy weather or when ground is frozen or otherwise un-tillable.
   1. Warranty
   1. At completion of work, furnish written warranty to Owner based upon requirements as specified.
   1. MAINTENANCE
   1. The interim maintenance period shall begin immediately after each area is seeded and continue until substantial completion of entire project. Final acceptance of seeded areas will not be given until Owner’s representative is satisfied with germination and a full stand of grass is in a vigorous growing condition, with consistency and completion of coverage. During this time, be responsible for watering, mowing, spraying, weeding fertilizing and all related work as necessary to ensure that seeded areas are in a vigorous growing condition. Provide all supervision, labor, material and equipment to maintain seeded areas.
   1. Constant, proactive maintenance of seed areas and regular reviews of the performance are critical to the successful establishment of seeded areas. The contractor is expected to monitor the seeded areas before and after the contract maintenance period and keep these as weed free as reasonably possible. This means throughout the construction period the contractor may need to apply herbicides as frequently as a weekly basis on areas infested with weeds (or undesirable species) or areas where aggressive weeds are observed. Mowing may be a suitable method for weed management as long as it is done so as not to prevent the spread of weed seeds. The contractor will be expected to include a weed management program as part of their bid.

   1. Unsatisfactory Conditions
   1. Report in writing to General Contractor with a copy to the Owner’s representative.
   1. Acceptance
   1. Beginning of installation means acceptance of existing conditions by this Contractor.
1. PREPARATION
   1. Protection
   1. Be responsible for proper repair to landscape, utilities, fences, pavements and other site improvements damaged by operations under this Section.
   1. Pay for repairs made by Contractor(s) designated by Owner.
   1. Identify prepared seeding areas requiring protection and erect barriers for proper protection and traffic control.
   1. Erosion Control
   1. Take measures and furnish equipment and labor necessary to control and prevent soil erosion, blowing soil and accumulation of wind-deposited materials on the site throughout the duration of work.
   1. Seeding Areas
   1. Remove weeds, debris and rocks larger than ½" which may binder seeding or subsequent operations. Dispose of accumulated debris at direction of Owner’s representative.
   1. Fine Grading
   1. Perform as required to maintain positive drainage, prevent ponding and direct run-off into catch basins, drainage structures, etc. and as required to provide smooth well-contoured surface prior to proceeding. Tolerance:
      1. + 0.04 foot within 50’ of walks, roads, and high visibility areas. In large areas of open space that are intended to be natural in appearance, a “rougher grade” is more desirable as it provides better soil stability and micro-climates for seed growth and diversity.
   1. Soil Preparation
   1. Soil preparation in all native seed areas is critical to the success and establishment of the plant material. Contractor is to ensure that all areas receive proper and adequate soil preparation.
   1. If the area to be developed is infested with noxious or invasive weeds, a chemical application will be required, at a rate recommended on the chemical’s product label.
   1. SEEDING
   1. Drill or plant in manner such that after surface is raked and rolled, seed shall have 1/4" of cover. Accomplish seeding by 'Rangeland' type drills. Any furrows left by drill seeding in areas where fine grading within 0.04 foot is required, shall be rolled to a smooth surface. Smaller areas inaccessible with a seed drill can be hand broadcast and the seed can be raked into the surface. 
   1. If broadcast seeding is necessary, the seed rate shall be doubled.
   1. Hydroseeding will not be allowed.
   1. On sloped or shaped areas, the first pass of the seeder shall attempt to follow the general contour. If multiple passes are required then the first pass and second passes should be close to perpendicular to each other. Each pass of the seeder should apply approximately ½ of the required seeding rate.
   1. All seeding shall occur between May 1st and October 1st, unless otherwise approved by the Owner’s Representative.
   1. One seeding shall occur between May 1st and June 1st.
   1. The second seeding shall Occur between August 15th and October 1st.
   1. Seeding may need to occur over consecutive landscape seasons as schedule requires.
   1. The second seeding may be broadcast seeding or drill seeded depending on the amount of coverage developed from the first seeding. If there is insufficient coverage from the first seeding, it should be assume the second seeding will required hydromulching.
   1. Reseeding
   1. Areas shall be reseeded if they exhibit areas greater than the acceptable amounts noted in Part 1 of this Section. Reseeding shall occur continually during the establishment period.
   1. mulch
   1. Utilize hydromulch and tackifier.
   1. Hydromulch shall be applied at a minimum rate of 2,000 pounds per acre with 3% tackifier.
   1. Timing
   1. Mulch seeded areas immediately after seeding. Areas not mulched within 24 hours after seeding shall be reseeded with the specified seed mix prior to mulching.

   1. EROSION CONTROL
   1. Apply erosion control netting to any area which is vulnerable to soil erosion such as swales or steep slopes.(3:1 or steeper slopes)
   1. If Contractor fails to net such areas and soil erosion subsequently occurs, Contractor shall re-establish finish grade, soil preparation, seed bed, and apply jute netting at their own expense.
   1. Erosion Control Netting
   1. Roll out in direction of flow after seeding and mulching.
   1. Apply material loosely and smoothly on soil surface without stretching and without tenting.
   1. Avoid walking directly on seed-bed either before or after material is applied.
   1. NOTIFICATION AND INSPECTION
   1. Inspection
   1. When seed and mulch are installed notify the Owner’s Representative for inspection and to turn over seed tags.
   1. When germination is complete, and plants are visible, the Contractor shall notify the Owner’s Representative. The inspection will be used to determine if the area is substantially complete and if the warranty period should commence. 
   1. All washouts, thin, weak, or dead areas should be repaired prior to the inspection.
   1. Deficiencies 
   1. Owner’s representative will specify deficiencies to Contractor who shall make satisfactory adjustments and shall again notify Owner’s representative for final inspection.
