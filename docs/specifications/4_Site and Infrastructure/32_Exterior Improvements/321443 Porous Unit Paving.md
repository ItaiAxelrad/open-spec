2. Reference Panel:
      1. Place reference panels on the project site, on a subgrade and base prepared as specified, using the material and construction requirements for pavement in this Specification. Each panel must have a surface area of at least 100 square feet (sf), and a width and thickness as specified for the pavement in the Contract Documents. The Engineer shall observe and accept each element of the paver construction prior to the placement of additional pavement. Failure to install acceptable reference panels of permeable/porous unit pavers will indicate an unqualified installer. Construction and evaluation of the reference panel(s) will occur as follows:
      1. Notify the Engineer at least ten (10) Working Days before installing paver reference panel.
      1. Coordinate the location of the reference panel with the Engineer. c. Notify the Engineer when each element of the reference panel is
ready for inspection.
      1. Remove, replace, and dispose of any unsatisfactory portions of reference panel as determined by the Engineer and at no additional cost to the Owner.
      1. Retain and maintain approved reference panel during construction in an undisturbed condition as a standard for judging completed portions of the final installations.
Approved reference panels may remain as final installations of the Work at the discretion of the Engineer. If not retained, the reference panel shall be removed and disposed at no additional cost to the Owner.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Mechanized installations may require a larger mock up area. Consult with the paver installation (Sub) Contractor on the size of the reference panel.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:

## EXECUTION

01.
   1. SUBGRADE PREPARATION AND PROTECTION
   1. Construct subgrade to +/- ¾ inch of the grades and slopes specified on the
Plans.
   1. Grading of subgrade shall be with low ground pressure equipment when within six (6) inches of final subgrade elevation.
   1. Compact subgrade to 90 percent (+/- 2 percent) of the maximum dry density per standard Proctor test (ASTM D698), or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer. Determination of in-place density shall be made using a nuclear gauge per ASTM D6939.
DESIGNER NOTE: The designer should set compaction requirements based on consideration of site specific geotechnical properties of the native soil (e.g., permeability, stiffness) and performance requirements for the pavement section (e.g., traffic loading, infiltration, cost).
   1. Areas of the subgrade which are over-compacted, as determined by the Geotechnical Engineer, shall be ripped/tilled to a depth of 12 inches (minimum) or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer and shall be recompacted in accordance with Section 3.01.C. Contractor shall locate all utilities within pavement footprint prior to ripping and re-compacting subgrade.
   1. Proof-roll prepared subgrade with loaded dump truck, remove soft spots, and replace with permeable structural fill as directed by the Engineer to achieve uniform subgrade.
1. March 2016 32 14 43 - 10
1. DIVISION 32 – EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS Section 32 14 43 – Permeable/Porous Unit Pavers
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Other subgrade verification methods may be required if site conditions limit proof rolling. Consult with geotechnical engineer for acceptable methods.
   1. After compaction and proof roll, scarify subgrade ¼- to ½-inch deep by hand rake. Once scarified, materials or equipment shall not be permitted within the prepared subgrade area so as to avoid recompaction or clogging of the scarified subgrade.
   1. The subgrade shall be protected from over-compaction or contamination by silty run-off or other contaminants.
1. Provide physical barriers or direct traffic to eliminate unnecessary vehicular traffic on the subgrade during construction in accordance with SFMTA and SFDPW ordinances and specifications.
2. Provide flow diversion and erosion control measures to protect the permeable pavement area from sedimentation until the upstream catchment area is thoroughly stabilized.
   1. Areas of subgrade over-compacted by construction traffic or other impacts by the Contractor or Subcontractors shall be ripped/tilled and re-compacted in accordance with Section 3.01.D. All work and materials required to correct the over-compacted subgrade, including utility locates within the pavement footprint, shall be at the Contractor’s expense.
   1. Areas of subgrade contaminated by the accumulation of silty material following rains or other debris or contamination shall be removed and disposed at the Contractor’s expense.
   1. The subgrade shall be inspected and accepted by the Engineer prior to placement of the geotextile or pavement base.
   1. Place geotextile, if required, on scarified subgrade. Care shall be taken to provide full coverage and to prevent the geotextile from being torn. Damaged geotextile shall be repaired as indicated by the manufacturer and to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no additional cost to the Owner. Overlaps of the geotextile shall be a minimum of 1 foot or to the manufacturer’s recommendation, whichever is greater.
DESIGNER NOTE: The use of geotextile under permeable pavement systems should be avoided unless required by the project geotechnical engineer as it can be prone to subsurface clogging.
02.
   1. PAVEMENT BASE
   1. Construct pavement base to the lines, grades, and thicknesses shown on the Plans.
   1. Place the pavement base so as to prevent loaded dump trucks from driving directly on the prepared subgrade.

   1. Compact pavement base, in six (6)-inch (maximum) lifts, by making a minimum of three passes over the pavement base material with a ten (10)-ton vibratory roller, or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer. The first two (2) passes (minimum) shall be in vibratory mode. The final pass shall be in static mode. Acceptance of the pavement base will be based on Engineer’s observation of aggregate movement during final compaction pass. Compaction equipment shall be accepted by the Engineer prior to use.
DESIGNER NOTE: For areas or sites that cannot accommodate a vibratory roller compactor, consider allowing compaction of pavement base with a
   1. 13,500 lbf (60 kN) minimum vibratory plate compactor with a compaction indicator. At least two passes should be made over each lift of the aggregates.
   1. Pavement base shall be true to the designed grade and slope, +/- 0.05 feet, after compaction for each layer. In the event of low spots, additional material shall be added and recompacted. In the event of high spots, excess material shall be removed and the area recompacted.
   1. Pavement base materials shall be protected from over-compaction or contamination by silty run-off or other contaminants.
1. Provide physical barriers or direct traffic to eliminate unnecessary vehicular traffic on the pavement base during construction in accordance with SFMTA and SFDPW ordinances and specifications.
2. Do not subject placed and compacted gravel leveling course to any pedestrian or vehicular traffic before unit paver installation begins.
3. Provide flow diversion and erosion control measures to protect the permeable pavement area from sedimentation until the upstream catchment area is thoroughly stabilized.
   1. Any damage to the pavement base (including contamination by silty run-off) shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer at the Contractor’s expense. Contaminated pavement base shall be removed and replaced to the limits as determined by the Engineer.
   1. The pavement base shall be inspected and accepted by the Engineer prior to placing any pavers.
DESIGNER NOTE: Consider developing a testing plan for the required testing and inspection of the pavement base. Verification of the in place density/compaction of the open graded base materials is typically not possible with the use of a nuclear densometer due to nature of these materials. Therefore other means to verify these materials are firm and unyielding (such as observation of the compaction process by a geotechnical engineer) are necessary.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Consider requiring the Contractor to compact aggregates without crushing them.

   1. PAVERS AND JOINT/OPENING FILL MATERIAL
   1. Lay the unit pavers in the pattern(s) and joint widths shown on the Plans.
Maintain straight pattern lines.
   1. Fill gaps at the edges of the paved area with cut units. Cut pavers subject to tire traffic shall be no smaller than 1/3 of a whole unit.
   1. Cut pavers and place along the edges with a double-bladed splitter or masonry saw.
   1. Fill all openings and joints with joint filler aggregate conforming to
Section 2.02.
   1. Remove excess aggregate on the surface by sweeping pavers clean.
   1. Compact and seat the pavers into the bedding material using a low- amplitude, 75 to 90 Hz plate compactor capable of at least 5,000 lbf (22 kN). This will require at least two passes with the plate compactor.
   1. Do not compact within 6 feet (2 m) of the unrestrained edges of unit pavers. H. Apply additional joint filler aggregate to the openings and joints if needed,
filling them completely. Remove excess aggregate by sweeping, then compact the pavers. This will require at least two passes with the plate compactor.
   1. All pavers within 6 feet (2 m) of the laying face must be left fully compacted and joints must be filled at the completion of each working day.
   1. Compacted unit pavers shall meet the acceptance criteria set forth in
Section 1.05.C.
04.
   1. PROTECTION OF PAVEMENT
   1. Pavement surface shall be kept clean and free of clogging debris and soils from the Contractor’s operations and all upstream and adjacent debris. If debris or soils contaminate the pavers/joints, the pavement shall be cleaned at the Contractor’s expense and to the satisfaction of the Engineer. If pavement cannot be unclogged, it shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
   1. Paver installation (Sub) Contractor shall return to the site after 6 months from the completion of the Work and provide the following as needed to fully meet the specifications described herein:
      1. fill paver joints with stones, replace broken or cracked pavers, and re-level settled pavers to initial elevations. **Any additional work shall be considered part of the original bid price and with no additional compensation.
05.
   1. REJECTION
   1. Pavers that do not meet the acceptance criteria set forth in Section 1.05.C will be rejected by the Engineer on a lot by lot basis. Permeable/porous unit pavers that have been rejected by the Engineer or the Contractor shall be removed and replaced at no additional cost to the Owner.
