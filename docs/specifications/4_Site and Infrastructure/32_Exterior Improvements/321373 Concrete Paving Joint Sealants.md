   1. preparation
   1. Protection
   1. Protect the Work and adjacent construction against damage. Clean Work adjacent to joints free of smears of sealant as Work progresses. Protect surfaces difficult to clean with masking tape or other suitable means not injurious to surfaces being protected.
   1. Joint Opening Preparation
   1. Substrates

## General

   1. Prepare joint openings in conformance with manufacturer's written instructions and ASTM C1193, and as specified.
   1. Dry, sound and thoroughly clean sealant substrates are required when primer (where required by manufacturer for optimum adhesion) and sealant are installed. Allow concrete, masonry or other porous substrates wetted by rain or other sources of moisture to dry for at least 24 hours under good drying conditions before application of primer or sealant. Protect surfaces that have been cleaned from contamination by deleterious materials such as oil, dust and rain, until primer (where required) and sealant are applied.
   1. Use cleaning solvents as recommended by the sealant manufacturer. Furnish containers for cleaning solvent storage that are clean, oil-free and suitable for use with the solvent.
   1. Masonry, concrete or other porous substrates.
   1. Remove loose particles, dirt, paint, foreign matter, and concrete curing compound by sandblasting, nylon bristle brush or other sealant manufacturer approved method not injurious to the substrate material and that will not change the appearance of the exposed surfaces adjacent to the sealant joint opening. Expose fine aggregate of concrete substrates to be sealed. Remove dust created by cleaning by repeated brushing with a soft bristle brush or by blowing dust from the substrate with oil-free compressed air.
   1. Clean sealant joint opening of mortar droppings and any other materials that affect finished sealant joint performance prior to installation of sealant backing material.
   1. Metal substrates
   1. Remove oils, residues from forming processes, corrosion and oxide build-up by nylon bristle brush, chemical cleaners or other sealant manufacturer approved method. Following removal, clean the substrate surface using the two-cloth system with a clean, lint free, white cloth soaked in solvent which is poured, not dipped, onto the cloth, followed by wiping the substrate surface dry, with the second clean, lint free, dry, white cloth before the solvent evaporates. Change to clean rags frequently. Brush application of solvents is not permitted.
   1. Coated metal or other non-porous substrates
   1. Clean the substrate surface using the two-cloth system with a clean, lint free, white cloth soaked in solvent which is poured, not dipped, onto the cloth, followed by wiping the substrate surface dry with the second dry, clean, lint free, white cloth before the solvent evaporates. Change to clean rags frequently. Brush application of solvents is not permitted.
   1. Clean organically coated (PVF, silicone-polyester, etc.) panels or other similar factory applied finishes with sealant and finish manufacturer approved solvent that is compatible with organic coating system.
   1. Elastomeric rubber and other organic substrates
   1. Submit organic materials to sealant manufacturer for compatibility testing by ASTM C1087 and adhesion testing by ASTM C794.
   1. Remove lubricants, release agents, dusting agents, and other materials from the substrate surface, using cleaning procedures based on the successful completion of the above testing, as provided in writing by the sealant manufacturer.
   1. Mortar joints
   1. Where indicated or specified, rake out mortar joints to width and depth indicated to receive sealant. Bring joints having excessive depth to proper depth with sealant backing specified. Rake out to proper depth joints that are too shallow.
   1. Primer
   1. Apply primer, as recommended by the sealant manufacturer, only to previously cleaned substrate surfaces to which sealants will be applied. The preferred method for application is with a clean, lint-free cloth for non-porous substrates and a clean natural bristle brush for porous substrates. Apply primer to the cloth or brush by pouring; dipping is not permitted. Take adequate measures, such as masking joint opening edges, to prevent primer from being applied to the face of adjacent surfaces. Allow primer to cure as recommended by the sealant manufacturer before installation of sealant.
   1. Prime only those substrate surfaces that can be sealed immediately after the recommended primer curing period to preclude dust, oil, rain, condensation or other deleterious conditions to contaminate primer.
   1. Sealant Backing Material
   1. Install sealant backing, of proper type and size, at proper depth in joint to provide specified joint dimensions. Place sealant backing into the joint to avoid lengthwise stretching, twisting, braiding or lapping. Provide continuity with tight butt joints. Install dry sealant backing immediately prior to installing sealant. Apply sealant with sealant backing in place unless otherwise indicated.
   1. Install closed cell sealant backing using good practices to avoid compression in excess of that specified or puncturing of the sealant backing material.
   1. If the sealant backing is to function as a temporary joint seal for weather protection or other reasons, for a period of time before sealant installation, remove the backing and replace it immediately prior to sealant installation with new sealant backing.
   1. Bond Breaker
   1. Install properly sized bond breaker tape so that the entire surface is covered. One tape may be lapped over another to achieve total coverage. Do not extend bond breaker tape onto the substrate surfaces to interrupt or prevent adhesion of the sealant to the substrate.
   1. Joint Dimensions
   1. Create joint opening depth (as measured at the sealant and substrate interface) for sealant contacting and bonded to substrate surfaces no less than 6 mm (1/4 inch) in depth. Minimum sealant depth at the mid-point of the joint width:
      1. 3 mm (1/8 inch).
   1. Unless indicated otherwise on the Drawings, for joint opening widths from 6 mm (1/4 inch) up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) wide, provide joint opening depth of 6 mm (1/4 inch); for joint opening widths over 13 mm (1/2 inch) to 19 mm (3/4 inch) wide, provide joint opening depth of one half the width; for joint opening widths over 19 mm (3/4 inch) to 50 mm (2 inches) wide, provide joint opening depth no greater than 10 mm (3/8 inch); and for joint opening widths exceeding 50 mm (2 inches), provide depth as determined by the sealant manufacturer.
   1. Refer to Drawings for joint opening requirements.
   1. Sealant Installation

## General

   1. Provide sealant in conformance with manufacturer's written instructions and ASTM C1193, and as specified.
   1. Inspect joint opening prior to sealant installation for proper installation of sealant backing or bond breaker, proper opening depth and proper substrate preparation, cleaning and (where required) priming.
   1. Do not apply sealant to damp, wet or frost covered substrates, sealant backing or bond breaker.
   1. Dry-tool exposed sealant surface immediately using no lubricant such as soap and water. A lubricant is allowed, if permitted by the sealant manufacturer and is a solvent or similar type product as recommended in writing by the sealant manufacturer.
   1. Where required or specified, to avoid smearing sealant on surfaces adjacent to joint opening, use masking tape or other suitable means and remove after tooling sealant surface and before sealant begins to cure. Organically coated (pvf, silicone-polyester, etc.) panels or other similar factory applied finishes shall be protected.
   1. Use drop cloths to cover horizontal or other surfaces likely to receive sealant droppings during installation.
   1. Non-Sag or Gunnable Sealant
   1. Apply non-sag sealant into joint opening with hand- or air-powered sealant gun so as to fill void completely. Use gun nozzle of proper size to fit joint opening.
   1. Take care not to smear adjoining surfaces with sealant. Force sealant, by tooling, fully into joint opening and intimate contact with substrate surface. Tool exposed joint surface so that a slight concave surface is formed. Use of the sealant gun for tooling is not allowed.
   1. Pourable or Self-Leveling Sealant
   1. Apply self-leveling sealant to finish close to the joint opening surface without overflowing and to form a slightly concave joint surface. Where required due to slope or other conditions, install a non-sag formulation of the same sealant in accordance with the procedures specified for that sealant type.
