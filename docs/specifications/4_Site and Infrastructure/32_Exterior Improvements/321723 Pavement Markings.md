## Execution

1. SURFACE PREPARATION
   1. Allow new pavement surfaces to cure for a period of not less than 30 days before application of marking materials. Surfaces to be marked shall be thoroughly cleaned before application of the paint. Dust, dirt, and other granular surface deposits shall be removed by sweeping, blowing with compressed air, rinsing with water, or a combination of these methods as required. Rubber deposits, existing paint markings, residual curing compounds, and other coatings adhering to the pavement shall be completely removed by water blasting or approved chemical removal method as directed. For Portland Cement Concrete pavement, grinding, light shot blasting, and light scarification, to a resulting profile equal to ICRI 03732 CSP 2, CSP 3, and CSP 4, respectively, can be used in addition to water blasting, to either remove existing coatings or for surface preparation on most pavements:
      1. shot blasting shall not be used on airfield pavements due to the potential of Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft. Scrub affected areas, where oil or grease is present on old pavements to be marked, with several applications of trisodium phosphate solution or other approved detergent or degreaser and rinse thoroughly after each application. After cleaning oil-soaked areas, pavement shall be sealed with shellac or primer recommended by the manufacturer to prevent bleeding through the new paint. Do not commence painting in any area until pavement surfaces are dry and clean.
   1. Early Painting of Rigid Pavements
1. Pretreat rigid pavements that require early painting with an aqueous solution containing 3 percent phosphoric acid and 2 percent zinc chloride. Apply the solution to the areas to be marked.
   1. Early Painting of Asphalt Pavements
1. For asphalt pavement systems requiring painting application at less than 30 days, apply the paint and beads at half the normal application rate, followed by a second application at the normal rate after 30 days.
2. APPLICATION
   1. Testing for Moisture
1. Pavement markings shall be applied to dry pavement only. The Contractor shall test the pavement surface for moisture before beginning work after each period of rainfall, fog, high humidity, or cleaning, or when the ambient temperature has fallen below the dew point. Do not commence marking until the pavement is sufficiently dry and the pavement condition has been approved by the Owner or authorized representative. Employ the "plastic wrap method" to test the pavement for moisture as follows:
      1. Cover the pavement with a 12 inch by 12 inch section of clear plastic wrap and seal the edges with tape. After 15 minutes, examine the plastic wrap for any visible moisture accumulation inside the plastic. Do not begin marking operations until the test can be performed with no visible moisture accumulation inside the plastic wrap.
   1. Rate of Application
1. Reflective Markings
      1. Paint shall be applied evenly to the pavement area to be coated at a rate of 105 plus or minus 5 square feet per gallon. High Build Acrylic Coating (HBAC) shall be applied at a rate of 50 square feet per gallon. Glass spheres shall be applied uniformly to the wet paint on airfield pavement at a rate of on airfield pavement at a rate of 10 plus or minus 0.5 pounds of glass spheres per gallon and on road and street pavement at a rate of 6 plus or minus 0.5 pounds of glass spheres per gallon. Collect and record readings for white and yellow retroreflective markings at the rate of one reading per 1000 linear feet. The minimum acceptable average for white markings is 200 millicandelas per square meter per lux (mcd/m2/lx) (measured with Mirolux 12 Retroreflectometer or similar instrument as agreed). The minimum acceptable average for yellow markings is 175 millicandelas per square meter per lux (mcd/m2/lx). Readings shall be computed by averaging a minimum of 10 readings taken within the area at random locations. Areas not meeting the retroreflective requirements stated above shall be remarked.
2. Nonreflective Markings

The asphalt concrete primer shall be allowed to dry to a tack-free condition, usually occurring in less than 10 minutes. The Portland Cement concrete primer shall be allowed to dry in accordance with the thermoplastic manufacturer recommendations. To shorten the curing time of the epoxy resins, an infrared heating device may be used on the concrete primer. Asphalt concrete primer shall be applied to all asphalt concrete pavements at a wet film thickness of 0.005 inch, plus or minus 0.001 inch 265 to 400 square feet per gallon. Portland cement concrete primer shall be applied to all concrete pavements (including concrete bridge decks) at a wet film thickness between 0.04 to 0.05 inch 320 to 400 square feet per gallon. After the primer has "set-up", the thermoplastic shall be applied at temperatures no lower than 375 degrees F nor higher than 425 degrees F at the point of deposition. Immediately after installation of the marking, drop-on reflective glass spheres shall be applied mechanically at the rate of one pound per 20 square feet such that the spheres are held by and imbedded in the surface of the molten material. All extruded thermoplastic markings shall be applied at the specified width and at a thickness of not less than 0.125 inch nor more than 0.190 inch. All sprayed thermoplastic markings shall be applied at the specified width and the thickness designated in the contract plans.

Work shall not proceed until the demonstration results are satisfactory to the Owner or authorized representative.
4. TRAFFIC CONTROL AND PROTECTION
   1. Place warning signs near the beginning of the work site and well ahead of the work site for alerting approaching traffic from both directions. Place small markers along newly painted lines to control traffic and prevent damage to newly painted surfaces. Mark painting equipment with large warning signs indicating slow-moving painting equipment in operation. Do not use foilbacked material for temporary pavement marking because of its potential to conduct electricity during accidents involving downed power lines.
5. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   1. Success of bond of reflective media, new paint marking and the pavement surfaces shall be demonstrated, vacuum cured surface of new marking after a seven (7) day dry time. Newly applied markings shall be inspected for signs of bond failure based on visual inspection and comparison to results from Test Stripe Demonstration paragraph.
   1. Reflective Media and Coating Bond Verification
1. Within seven (7) days after pavement marking application, industrial vacuum shall be used to sweep new markings. The pavement markings shall be visually inspected and the material captured by the vacuum. Verify that no significant loss of reflective media has occurred to the pavement marking due to the vacuum cleaning.
   1. Reflective Media and Coating Application Verification
1. Use a wet film thickness gauge to measure the application of wet paint.
2. Use a microscope or magnifying glass to evaluate the embedment of glass beads in the paint. Verify the glass bead embedment with approximately 50% of the beads embedded and 50% of the beads exposed.

   1. Notes:
      1. (1) Properly mix and apply yellow paint at (10 mils +/- 2 mils) DFT over a suitably sized, clean aluminum substrate (ASTM D 823), and cure for a minimum of 48 hours:
         1. four individual yellow samples shall be prepared. Expose three samples to continuous Ultraviolet (UV) light for 2500 hours, without cycles condensation, in accordance to ASTM G 53:
         1. UVA-340 lamps shall be used in the testing apparatus. Following exposure, compare the three exposed samples to the "one" non-exposed sample using FED-STD-595 colors 33538 and 33655 as visual references:
         1. evaluate exposed samples for degree of visual color loss. Yellow paint shall receive a passing rating if each exposed sample appears equivalent to the non-exposed sample, and in addition, displays color loss no greater than FED-STD-595 color 33655.

(2) Using double-stick, foam mounting tape (or equal) with a nominal thickness of (65 mils); apply a rectangular mold with inner dimensions of (3 in by 10 in) to a clean aluminum sample approximately sized at (6 in by 12 in by 1/8 in). Do not remove the tape's plastic backing. Mix and apply excess paint into mold. Remove excess paint, by squeegee or other appropriate draw down technique, to a uniform thickness equal to the tape's height. Paint application and draw down shall be performed within a period of no more than 60 seconds. Approximately one to two minutes following the draw down, remove tape from sample and allow coating to cure for a minimum period of one week ASTM D 3924. Using a micrometer or other appropriate device, measure cured coating thickness (less sample thickness) to confirm resulting coating application was at or above 950 microns (38 mils) DFT. Inspect coating for visual signs of cracking and curling. Following a one week cure, coating shall receive a passing rating if applied greater than (38 mils) DFT and visually free of both cracking and curling.
