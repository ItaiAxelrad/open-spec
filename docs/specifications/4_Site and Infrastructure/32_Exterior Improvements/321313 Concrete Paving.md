## General

ly retain first option in first subparagraph below unless concrete with lighter shades or brighter colors is required. See Evaluations.
   1. Retain one or both of first two subparagraphs below if supplementary cementing materials are permitted. Generally delete both subparagraphs if using white portland cement. Ready-mix plants blend these materials with portland cement. Fly ash and slag may slow rate of concrete strengthening and affect color uniformity. Use of Type C or Type F fly ash may be determined by regional availability as well as by properties cited in ASTM C 618.
   1. Retain subparagraph below if factory-blended hydraulic cement is permitted. Insert target percentage or range of slag or pozzolan as a suffix to Type IS or Type IP designations if required; insert special properties if required. See Evaluations. Verify availability of options before specifying. Slag or pozzolan in nonportland cement part of blended hydraulic cement may slow rate of concrete strengthening and affect color uniformity of integrally colored concrete.
   1. Retain one of first three options in first paragraph below or revise to suit Project. ASTM C 33 limits deleterious substances in coarse aggregate depending on climate severity and in-service location of concrete. Classes 4S, 4M, and 1N apply to paving in Severe, Moderate, and Negligible weathering regions, respectively. Consider retaining last option below if damage caused by concrete expansion from alkali-silica or other chemical reactions is anticipated.

Fiber manufacturer must document evidence of 5 year satisfactory performance history, compliance with applicable building codes and ASTM C1116 Type III 4.1.3 and ASTM C1116 Performance Level I. Fibrous concrete reinforcement shall be manufactured by Fibermesh Company, 4019 Industry Drive, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA 37416 or approved equal.

   1. Evaporation retarder in first paragraph below temporarily reduces moisture loss from concrete surfaces awaiting finishing in hot, dry, and windy conditions. Evaporation retarders are not curing compounds or chemical surface retarders used to delay concrete setting.
   1. Retain paragraph below if a white, waterborne, membrane-forming curing compound is required. Retain if more reflectivity is required. Review product choices because some dissipate and others are abraded by traffic.

   1. Comply with ACI 306.1 for cold-weather protection.
   1. If evaporation rate in first paragraph below is exceeded, ACI 305R states that plastic shrinkage cracking is probable. See manufacturers' literature or ACI 305R for estimated moisture-loss chart that relates relative humidity, air and concrete temperature, and wind velocity to rate of evaporation.
   1. Begin curing after finishing concrete but not before free water has disappeared from concrete surface.
   1. Retain one or more options in paragraph below. Do not use curing compound on surfaces to be covered by unit pavers, tiles, or other materials set in mortar.
   1. Curing Methods:
      1. Cure concrete by moisture curing, moisture-retaining-cover curing, curing compound or a combination of these as follows:
      1. Retain one or more subparagraphs below to suit Project. If retaining more than one, indicate locations of each curing method on Drawings.
   1. Moisture Curing:
      1. Keep surfaces continuously moist for not less than seven days with the following materials:

   1. Water.
   1. Continuous water-fog spray.
   1. Absorptive cover, water saturated and kept continuously wet. Cover concrete surfaces and edges with 12-inch lap over adjacent absorptive covers.
   1. Moisture-Retaining-Cover Curing:
      1. Cover concrete surfaces with moisture-retaining cover, placed in widest practicable width, with sides and ends lapped at least 12 inches and sealed by waterproof tape or adhesive. Immediately repair any holes or tears occurring during installation or curing period using cover material and waterproof tape.
   1. Do not use curing compound in subparagraph below on surfaces to be covered by unit pavers, tiles, or other materials set in mortar.
   1. Curing Compound:
      1. Apply uniformly in continuous operation by power spray or roller according to manufacturer's written instructions. Recoat areas that have been subjected to heavy rainfall within three hours after initial application. Maintain continuity of coating, and repair damage during curing period.
   1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Retain first paragraph below to identify who shall perform tests and inspections. If retaining second option, retain "Field quality-control reports" Paragraph in "Submittals" Article.
   1. Testing Agency:
      1. Engage a qualified testing agency to perform tests and inspections.
   1. Retain first paragraph below to suit Project; delete if not required for small work.
   1. Testing Services:
      1. Testing of composite samples of fresh concrete obtained according to ASTM C 172 shall be performed according to the following requirements:
      1. Revise frequency of testing in first subparagraph below to suit Project. First option is based on ACI 301 (ACI 301M), second on ACI 318 (ACI 318M) for slabs.
   1. Testing Frequency:
      1. Obtain at least one composite sample for each 100 cu. yd**.** or fraction thereof of each concrete mixture placed each day.
   1. Retain first subparagraph below with either option in subparagraph above.
   1. When frequency of testing will provide fewer than five compressive-strength tests for each concrete mixture, testing shall be conducted from at least five randomly selected batches or from each batch if fewer than five are used.
   1. Slump:
      1. ASTM C 143/C 143M; one test at point of placement for each composite sample, but not less than one test for each day's pour of each concrete mixture. Perform additional tests when concrete consistency appears to change.
   1. Air Content:
      1. ASTM C 231, pressure method; one test for each composite sample, but not less than one test for each day's pour of each concrete mixture.
   1. Concrete Temperature:
      1. ASTM C 1064/C 1064M; one test hourly when air temperature is 40 deg F and below and when it is 80 deg F and above, and one test for each composite sample.
   1. Revise number of laboratory- or field-cured test specimens in first subparagraph below if required.
   1. Compression Test Specimens:
      1. ASTM C 31/C 31M; cast and laboratory cure one set of four standard cylinder specimens for each composite sample.

   1. Test results shall be reported in writing to Architect, concrete manufacturer, and Contractor within 48 hours of testing. Reports of compressive-strength tests shall contain Project identification name and number, date of concrete placement, name of concrete testing and inspecting agency, location of concrete batch in Work, design compressive strength at 28 days, concrete mixture proportions and materials, compressive breaking strength, and type of break for both 7- and 28-day tests.
   1. Nondestructive Testing:
      1. Impact hammer, sonoscope, or other nondestructive device may be permitted by Architect but will not be used as sole basis for approval or rejection of concrete.
   1. Additional Tests:
      1. Testing and inspecting agency shall make additional tests of concrete when test results indicate that slump, air entrainment, compressive strengths, or other requirements have not been met, as directed by Architect.
   1. See Division 01 Section "Quality Requirements" for retesting and reinspecting requirements and Division 01 Section "Execution" for requirements for correcting the Work.

   1. Protect concrete paving from damage. Exclude traffic from paving for at least 14 days after placement. When construction traffic is permitted, maintain paving as clean as possible by removing surface stains and spillage of materials as they occur.
   1. Maintain concrete paving free of stains, discoloration, dirt, and other foreign material. Sweep paving not more than two days before date scheduled for Substantial Completion inspections.
