2. See Specification Section 01 33 00 for requirements for the mechanics and administration of the submittal process.
3. Seed and Fertilizer:
      1. The Contractor shall submit the seed and fertilizer mix proposed for use on the project for approval prior to application.
4. Sod:
      1. The Contractor shall submit a sample of the sod he proposes to furnish. The sample shall serve as the standard for the project. Sod furnished which is not compatible with the standard sample will not be accepted.

2. Soil Retention Blanket:
	1. Jute: The blanket shall consist of heavy jute mesh of a uniform open plain weave of unbleached yarn. The yarn shall be of a loosely twisted construction having an average twist of not less than 1.6 turns per inch and shall not vary in thickness by more than one-half its normal diameter. The jute mesh shall be furnished in approximately 90 pound rolled strips and shall meet the following requirements:
		1. Length - approximately 75 yards
		2. Width - 48-inches plus 1-inch; 78 warp ends per width of cloth; 41 weft ends per yard.
		3. Weight of cloth to average 1.22-pounds per linear yard with a tolerance of plus or minus 5 percent.
	2. Plastic Net: The plastic net shall be a biodegradable extruded oriented net with a rectangular mesh opening of approximately 1.5 x 1 strands per square inch and a nominal weight of 2.6 pounds per 100 square feet.
	3. Pins and Staples: Pins or staples shall be made of wire .091 inch or larger in diameter. “U” shaped staples shall have legs 6-inch long and 1-inch crown. “T” shaped pins shall have a minimum length of 8-inches after bending. The bar of the “T” shall be at least 4 inches long with the single wire and bent downward approximately 3/4-inch.


## Execution

1. 3.1 Preparation
	 1. General: In all disturbed areas, topsoil is to be salvaged and replaced. Prior to any re-vegetation activity, the soil shall be tilled to provide at least 2 to 4-inches of loose surface.
1. 3.2 Application
   1. Native Seed:
	1. 3:1 Slopes or flatter: Seeding shall be accomplished by means of an approved drill-type seeder at a rate of 20lbs. per acre PLS or broadcast at 40 lbs. per acre PLS.
	2. Slopes steeper than 3:1: Seeding shall be accomplished by means of an approved drill-type seeder whenever possible. Otherwise seed shall be sown with an approved broadcast-type seeder. The seeded area shall then be raked lightly to provide about 1/2-inch of cover over the seed unless hydraulic broadcasting and mulching is used.
	3. Seeding Period and Maintenance: It is preferred that native seeding be accomplished before May 15th or after August 15th. Seeding may be done between May 15th and August 15th but this may require considerable additional watering by the Contractor between May 15th and August 15th, the Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining and adequately watering seeded areas during the warranty period of five weeks after the time of seeding. Areas in which there is not a satisfactory stand at the expiration of the five week period shall be reseeded once to provide acceptable re-vegetation at the end of the warranty period. Seed shall not be sown during windy weather or when the ground is frozen or otherwise un-tillable.
2. Fertilizer:
      1. Fertilization is applicable on jobs only when a separate bid item is included in the Bid section. The fertilizer shall be tilled into the top 2-inches of the soil at a rate of 300 pounds per acre.
3. Soil Retention Blanket:
	1. The blankets shall be placed immediately after seeding operations have been completed in each location as specified on the Plan.
	2. The material shall be applied smoothly but loosely on the silt surface without stretching. Workers should avoid, as much as possible, walking directly on the seedbed either before or after the mesh is applied. The up slope end of each piece of mesh shall be buried in a narrow trench six (6) inches deep. After the mesh is buried, the trench should be tamped firmly closed.
	3. In cases where one roll of mesh ends and a second roll starts, the up slope piece should be brought over the buried and of the second roll so that there is a 12-inch overlap to form a junction slot. Where two or more widths of mesh are applied side by side, an overlap of at least four (4) inches must be made.
	4. Check slots should be made before the mesh is rolled out. A narrow trench should be dug across the slope perpendicular to the direction of flow. A piece of mesh, cut the same length as the trench, is folded lengthwise. The fold is placed in the trench and the trench is tamped closed. The portion of the mesh remaining above ground is unfolded and laid flat on the soil surface. Check slots will be spaced so that one check slope or junction slot occurs within each 50-feet of slope. Overlaps which run down the slope, outside edges and centers shall be of staples down the center as well as along each edge. Check slots and junction slots will be stapled across at 6-inch intervals. For extra hard soil, use sharp-pointed, hardened steel, 3-inch fence type staples.
	5. Matting must be spread evenly and smoothly and be in contact with the seeded area at all points. It shall be pressed into the soil with a light lawn roller or by a similar method. The Contractor shall maintain the mesh areas until all work on the entire Contract has been completed and accepted. Maintenance shall consist of the repair of areas damaged by erosion, wind fire, or other causes. Such areas shall be repaired to e-establish the condition and grade of the soil prior to application of the mesh and shall be re-fertilized, reseeded and re-mulched as directed.
