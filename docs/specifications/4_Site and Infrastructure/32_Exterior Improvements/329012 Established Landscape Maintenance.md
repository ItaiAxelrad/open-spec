   1. EXECUTION
   1. TREE MAINTENANCE
   1. Pruning 
   1. The following will be used as guidelines for pruning maintenance on trees. Pruning will be accomplished in the early spring and late winter. Pruning in this agreement will be initiated for the following.
   1. Plants too close to a building, walkway, fence, power line or any tree limiting visibility shall be pruned appropriately to reduce the obstructing branches.
   1. Removal of diseased or insect infested or weak growth portions of the tree.
   1. Pruning to remove storm damage or other mechanical injury. Pruning to shape or remove excess unwanted growth or winter die back.
   1. Prune trees to select and develop permanent scaffold branches that are smaller in diameter than the trunk or 48 inches and radial orientation so as not to overlay one another; to eliminate diseased or damaged growth; to eliminate narrow V-shaped branch forks that lack strength; to reduce toppling and wind damage by thinning out crowns; to maintain growth within space limitations; to maintain a natural appearance; to balance crown with roots. Under no circumstances will stripping of lower branches ("raising up") of young trees be permitted. Lower branches shall be retained in a "tipped back" or pinched condition with as much foliage as possible to promote caliper trunk growth (tapered trunk). Lower branches can be cut flush with the trunk only after the tree is able to stand erect without staking or other support.
   1. The primary pruning of deciduous trees shall be done during the dormant season. Damaged trees or those that constitute health or safety hazards shall be pruned at any time of the year as required. 
   1. Coniferous trees shall be thinned out and shaped when necessary to prevent wind and storm damage. 
   1. Pruning for general clean-up of trees is required in the late winter or early spring prior to the activation of the irrigation system. 
   1. Pruning specified as "normal maintenance" will include trees or tree limbs, that are up to twelve (12) feet tall using conventional pruning tools. 
   1. The contractor must immediately contact the Owner concerning trees which may present a threat to the public safety. The Owner should be contacted so that the threat may be eliminated and a price negotiated for the repair. 
   1. The contractor is not responsible to repair or replace any plant materials damaged or killed by vandalism or extreme conditions beyond the contractor's control, as reasonably determined by the Owner’s Representative. Plant materials damaged or killed as the result of a contractor's actions or neglect will be replaced in kind at the contractor's expense.
   1. All pruning will be performed by qualified personnel may require supervision by an arborist if requested by the Owner.
   1. Final cuts on branch removal must be made just outside the flare of the branch base, not flush with the tree trunk.
   1. Limbs removed from a tree must be cut near a crotch. Bracing, cabling and lip bolting may be required in special instances. 
   1. Damaged, dead or dying trees and shrubs will be removed immediately upon being observed by maintenance staff. 
   1. Damaged trees or those which constitute health or safety hazards will be pruned or removed at any time of the year as required. 
   1. Cost to remove and dispose of dead plant material is the sole responsibility of the contractor.

   1. The contractor must take prompt action to repair any injuries that occur to plants and immediately initiate the repair. Repairs will be completed only by competent employees trained and familiar with repair techniques.
   1. Storm or severe wind injury must be addressed immediately after any storm to determine the extent of any plant related injuries.
   1. Bark may also be destroyed by animals, sunscald, mowers or vandalism. The contractor shall treat bark injuries according to the current industry standards.
   1. Tree paint shall not be used to treat wounds.
   1. Tree Wrap
   1. Deciduous trees with up to a 4” trunk diameter for newer, less established thin bark deciduous trees will be wrapped each fall no later than November 1st. Tree wrap shall be removed no later than May 15th. 
   1. Or as required by weather, location of tree, or other environmental factors. 
   1. Wrap from the ground to the first major branch. Secure by stapling or using jute. Do not use electrical tape. Wrap trees between November 15 and April 15. 
   1. Remove wrap during the growing season, from April 15 to November 15. 
   1. Use a commercially available tree wrap.
   1. Fertilization
   1. Fertilize trees with 18-7-10 formulation, slow release fertilizer. Apply 6 oz./100 s.f. Apply once in spring. Apply by spreading fertilizer evenly around the ball of the tree. Apply from the trunk out to the drip line.
   1. If trees exhibit iron chlorosis, provide foliar fertilization with chelated iron. Cost of foliar fertilization is a part of this contract. Avoid contact with all stainable surfaces including concrete sidewalks, pavers, planter walls, rock mulch, project signage, and lights. Obtain written authorization of Owner’s Representative prior to fertilization.
   1. Insecticide application:
      1.

   1. Cut back ornamental grasses to ¼ of their mature height in the spring during March. Remove and dispose of cuttings.
   1. Cut back herbaceous perennials to the ground in March. Remove and dispose of cuttings.
   1. Prune all dead, diseased, and dying branches.

      1. overgrown shrubs usually are leggy, lacking foliage in the lower one-half to two-thirds due to shading from the top or non-flowering. This pruning activity should be accomplished during the dormant season pruning. Height reduction may be accomplished at the same time. This activity is accomplished by removing the oldest and weakest canes at or near ground line. All branches can be cut to the ground or one-third of the oldest branches can be removed every year.
   1. Thinning shrubs:
      1. the contractor will remove the oldest canes each winter (canes over four (4) seasons old). Insignificant small shoots will be removed to the base or to the crotch of the plant.
   1. Heading back:
      1. the contractor will head back isolated shoots which may cause the plants to become out of balance. Prune to the base of the branch or the crotch.
   1. Fertilization
