A ledger showing all purchased components shall be provided to the Property Management by October 15th of each year.
1.  References
1.  See Green Industries of Colorado ([www.greenco.org](http://www.greenco.org)) Best Management Practices (BMP) for information on water budgeting and irrigation efficiency.
1.  PROJECT COMMUNICATION
1.  The Contractor shall have one person designated as the Contract Manager. That person shall be available for a meeting and/or walk through of the property, at least once each month, upon the request of the management or owner group.
1.  It is expected that the Contractor will advise the Property Manager or it’s representatives, of all actions the Contractor reasonably believes are prudent, necessary, or beneficial, to improve and maintain the appearance and health of the landscape at the property.
1.  The facilities manager will act as the central control operator and will be responsible for programming controllers and development of irrigation watering schedules.
1.  The central controller operator will provide irrigation schedules so that staff understands when and where monitoring will need to occur.
1.  Any changes required or requested to the irrigation programs should be reported to the central controller operator immediately and in writing (e-mail is acceptable notification).
1.  The central control operator shall be notified of all mowing, fertilizer, and herbicide schedules so programs can be adjusted appropriately. A minimum of 3 days notice is required.
1.  The Contractor will be responsible for communication programming errors observed and requesting changes to the programs.
1.  SCOPE
1.  The Work includes the furnishing of labor, materials, equipment, accessories, (services and materials) necessary to maintain the irrigation system and the turf and plants in a healthy and neat growing condition.
1.  A weekly property inspection report shall be submitted by the Contractor to the Owner’s Representative, detailing the following.
1.  Work performed during the previous week.
1.  Detail of problems encountered and corrective action already taken or proposed. Work to be performed or recommended during the upcoming week.
1.  Contractor shall also maintain inspection records discussing the condition of the following.
1.  Turf
1.  Planting beds
1.  Trees
1.  Whenever the Contractor observes any condition which they believe may be detrimental to healthy plant material, such conditions shall be immediately brought to the Owners Representative’s attention along with a recommendation of corrective action.
1.  DAMAGE
1.  The Contractor is responsible for marking and repairing any damage (to the Property Manager’s satisfaction) that results from the maintenance operations at no additional cost to the Owner.
1.  Damage repair to the irrigation system not resulting from the Contractor's operation and negligence, will be considered "extra work.” This work will be paid based upon a price for repairs agreed to by the Manager and Contractor prior to commencing work. Repairs not included are normal wear and tear of the system and breakage by the contractor.
1.  The following procedure will be followed regarding emergency repairs. Emergency repair will be promptly acted on by the Contractor. The Contractor will react to mainline breaks immediately shutting down the system and/or closing gate valves to isolate the area. The Contractor must respond immediately to eliminate any threat of property damage or public safety. The Contractor may be liable for any damages and associated costs which result from a failure to respond to emergencies under the limits of this agreement. Immediately after isolating the issues, the Contractor will present the emergency repair and associated costs and estimates to the Owner’s Representative for a decision on the repair(s).
1.  Whenever possible do not shut down the irrigation pumps, meter, or backflows to isolate damaged areas – gate valves in the mainline should be the first course of corrective action always.

## Products

1.  Refer to plans.

## Execution

1.  field quality control
1.  The contractor shall perform a full irrigation system inspection immediately after the irrigation pump has become active and provide a written report of all damages observed. All damages shall be repaired prior to May 1st.
1.  The contractor shall have staff present to monitor the operation of the irrigation system on a daily basis. The daily morning inspection shall focus on the previous night’s irrigation areas to ensure all zones that were scheduled to water were watered. On days when the irrigation system is not operating because of rain delays or shut downs by the central control operator, the inspection will not be required. Monitoring of the irrigation system will be necessary every morning of the week, regardless of holidays or non-standard working periods. Monitor each zone to ensure adequate, but not excessive water is being applied.
1.  The Contractor will inspect the irrigation system weekly for broken and clogged heads, malfunctioning or leaking valves, or any other conditions which hamper the correct operation of the system. These inspections will generally coincide with mowing operations.
1.  During the first week of each month the contractor will manually operate all manicured turf zones and observe their performance and coverage. Zones shall be operated long enough to allow the entire zone to be come fully pressurized and for rotors to complete at least two full cycles. This detailed inspection shall also include a visual inspection to see that heads point toward the turf, heads are in a vertical position, and no heads are missing.
1.  The Contractor shall unclog heads and shall make head adjustments to include spray patterns, at no additional cost. If clogging appears to be excessive as a result of water quality (as determined by the Owner’s Representative) additional compensation may be justified.
1.  The Contractor shall be held fully responsible for the loss of any planted goods, turf or trees due to improper irrigation practices or malfunctioning systems if it is within their control.
1.  Flagging tape and marker flags shall be used to identify damages, over watering, or areas that require attention.
1.  CONTROLLERS
1.  The Contractor will keep the controllers and enclosures and access to central computer locked at all times except when servicing or performing routine maintenance operations requiring access to equipment.
1.  The Contractor will maintain all controllers on the automatic setting and linked to the Maxicom system at all times, unless otherwise directed by the central control operator.
1.  Adjusting and ROUTINE MAINTENANCE INCLUDES
1.  Inspecting the irrigation system broken and clogged heads, malfunctioning or leaking valves, or any other conditions which hamper the correct operation of the system.
1.  Cleaning and adjusting irrigation heads and control valves for optimum performance.
1.  Checking bubbler and drip systems for watering efficiency and cleaning as necessary.
1.  Maintenance as required by the manufacturer to all drip systems components. Clean and/or replace drip valve filters to remove debris and algae.
1.  Any damage resulting due to activities of the Contractor will be replaced at the Contractor's expense.
1.  Prior to commencing any repairs that are not time sensitive, the Contractor shall first consult with and obtain permission of the Owner’s Representative, outlining the work to be done and the cost.
1.  Valve box lids shall be immediately replaced after all maintenance operations each day. Any damage of valve box lids shall be replaced or repaired immediately by Contractor. Contractor shall be responsible and liable for any valve box lid not replaced, and for all consequences and damages from such failure to replace the lids, foreseen and unforeseen.
1.  Trim grass around heads and valve boxes as necessary to ensure proper operation of heads and accessibility to control valves.
1.  Make needed repairs as soon as possible and in compliance with the maintenance contract.
1.  irrigation audits for manicured turf
1.  A visual audit (or assessment) should be performed on a regular basis, for manicured turf zones, to ensure that the system is still functioning as designed, to assist in identifying issues preventing the proper operation, or to identify inadequate coverage for manicured turf areas only.
1.  Audits may also be conducted at the change of maintenance companies to minimize the risk of inheriting issues with the irrigation system.
1.  Following the irrigation audit, the contractor may submit a plan for fixing all operational defects.
1.  STARTUP PROCEEDURES (APRIL 15)
1.  Activate the irrigation pumps and or the full system on or around April 15th.
1.  The Contractor will be familiar with the location of all gate valves through out the project. Prior to pressurizing the system all gate valves (isolation valves) shall be opened.
1.  While pressurizing the irrigation mainline the central control operator must be involved. After the system is pressurized, the irrigation zones located at the high points of the system will be opened to evacuate air from the mainline by central control.
1.  Winterization Procedures
1.  The contractor will be responsible for winterizing the irrigation system.
1.  Close isolation valves as needed to create smaller areas for evacuating water from the system. After the entire system has been winterized the isolation valves may be re-opened.
1.  Connect the compressor to the system at quick coupler locations throughout the area. Maximum air pressure should not exceed 100 psi of pressure at the air compressor.
1.  Start pumping compressed air into the system only after the first station on the controller is activated or opened. If no valves are open, severe damage can result from the high air pressure in the mainline. At the controller, cycle through each station, allowing each valve to open for approximately 5 minutes or until all the water is evacuated from each zone.
1.  Open manual drain valves.
1.  Winterization of the irrigation pump is required.
