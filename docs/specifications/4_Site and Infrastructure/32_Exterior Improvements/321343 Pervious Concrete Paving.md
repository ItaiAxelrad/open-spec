## Execution

1.  1.  SUBGRADE PREPARATION AND PROTECTION
    1.  Construct subgrade to +/- ¾ inch of the grades and slopes specified on the
        Plans.
    1.  Grading of subgrade shall be with low ground pressure equipment when within six (6) inches of final subgrade elevation.
    1.  Compact subgrade to 90 percent (+/- 2 percent) of the maximum dry density per standard Proctor test (ASTM D698), or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer. Determination of in-place density shall be made using a nuclear gauge per ASTM D6939.
        DESIGNER NOTE: The designer should set compaction requirements based on consideration of site specific geotechnical properties of the native soil (e.g., permeability, stiffness) and performance requirements for the pavement section (e.g., traffic loading, infiltration, cost).
    1.  Areas of the subgrade which are over-compacted, as determined by the Geotechnical Engineer, shall be ripped/tilled to a depth of 12 inches (minimum) or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer and shall be recompacted in accordance with Section 3.01.C. Contractor shall locate all utilities within pavement footprint prior to ripping and re-compacting subgrade.
    1.  Proof-roll prepared subgrade with loaded dump truck, remove soft spots, and replace with permeable structural fill as directed by the Engineer to achieve uniform subgrade.
        DESIGNER NOTE: Other subgrade verification methods may be required if site conditions limit proof rolling. Consult with geotechnical engineer for acceptable methods.
    1.  After compaction and proof roll, scarify subgrade ¼- to ½-inch deep by hand rake. Once scarified, materials or equipment shall not be permitted within the prepared subgrade area so as to avoid recompaction or clogging of the scarified subgrade.
1.  March 2016 32 13 43 - 16
1.  DIVISION 32 – EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS Section 32 13 43 – Pervious Concrete
    1.  The subgrade shall be protected from over-compaction or contamination by silty run-off or other contaminants.
1.  Provide physical barriers or direct traffic to eliminate unnecessary vehicular traffic on the subgrade during construction in accordance with SFMTA and SFDPW ordinances and specifications.
1.  Provide flow diversion and erosion control measures to protect the permeable pavement area from sedimentation until the upstream catchment area is thoroughly stabilized.
    1.  Areas of subgrade over-compacted by construction traffic or other impacts by the Contractor or Subcontractors shall be ripped/tilled and re-compacted in accordance with Section 3.01.D. All work and materials required to correct over-compacted subgrade, including utility locates within the pavement footprint, shall be at the Contractor’s expense.
    1.  Areas of subgrade contaminated by the accumulation of silty material following rains or other debris or contamination shall be removed and disposed at the Contractor’s expense.
    1.  The subgrade shall be inspected and accepted by the Engineer prior to placement of the geotextile or pavement base.
    1.  Place geotextile, if required, on scarified subgrade. Care shall be taken to provide full coverage and to prevent the geotextile from being torn. Damaged geotextile shall be repaired as indicated by the manufacturer and to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no additional cost to the Owner. Overlaps of the geotextile shall be a minimum of one (1) foot or to the manufacturer’s recommendation, whichever is greater.
        DESIGNER NOTE: The use of geotextile under permeable pavement systems should be avoided unless required by the project geotechnical engineer as it can be prone to subsurface clogging.
1.  1.  PAVEMENT BASE
    1.  Construct pavement base to the lines, grades, and thicknesses shown on the Plans.
    1.  Place the pavement base so as to prevent loaded dump trucks from driving directly on the prepared subgrade.
    1.  Compact pavement base, in six (6) inch (maximum) lifts, by making a minimum of three passes over the pavement base material with a ten (10) ton vibratory roller, or as directed by the Geotechnical Engineer. The first two (2) passes (minimum) shall be in vibratory mode. The final pass shall be in static mode. Acceptance of the pavement base will be based on Engineer’s observation of aggregate movement during final compaction pass. Compaction equipment shall be accepted by the Engineer prior to use.
1.  March 2016 32 13 43 - 17
1.  DIVISION 32 – EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS Section 32 13 43 – Pervious Concrete
    1.  DESIGNER NOTE:
        1. For areas or sites that cannot accommodate a vibratory roller compactor, consider allowing compaction of pavement base with a
    1.  13,500 lbf (60 kN) minimum vibratory plate compactor with a compaction indicator. At least two passes should be made over each lift of the aggregates.
    1.  Pavement base shall be true to the designed grade and slope, +/- 0.05 feet, after compaction for each layer. In the event of low spots, additional material shall be added and recompacted. In the event of high spots, excess material shall be removed and the area recompacted.
    1.  The pavement base shall be protected from over-compaction or contamination by silty run-off or other contaminants.
1.  Provide physical barriers or direct traffic to eliminate unnecessary vehicular traffic on the pavement base during construction in accordance with SFMTA and SFDPW ordinances and specifications.
1.  Provide flow diversion and erosion control measures to protect the permeable pavement area from sedimentation until the upstream catchment area is thoroughly stabilized.
    1.  Any damage to the pavement base (including contamination by silty run-off) shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer at the Contractor’s expense. Contaminated pavement base shall be removed and replaced to the limits as determined by the Engineer.
    1.  The pavement base shall be inspected and accepted by the Engineer prior to placing any pervious concrete.
        DESIGNER NOTE: Consider developing a testing plan for the required testing and inspection of the pavement base. Verification of the in place density/compaction of the open graded base materials is typically not possible with the use of a nuclear densometer due to nature of these materials. Therefore other means to verify these materials are firm and unyielding (such as observation of the compaction process by a geotechnical engineer) are necessary.
    1.  DESIGNER NOTE:
        1. Consider requiring the Contractor to compact aggregates without crushing them.
1.  1.  MIXING, PLACEMENT & CURING OF PERVIOUS CONCRETE
    1.  Pervious concrete formwork
1.  Forms shall be made of steel or wood and shall be in good condition, clean, and capable of being anchored in place so as to ensure pavement placement true to the grades, lines and slopes as specified on the Plans.
