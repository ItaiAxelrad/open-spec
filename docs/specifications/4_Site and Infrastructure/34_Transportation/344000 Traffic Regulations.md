Suitable lighted barriers or barricades shall be furnished by the Contractor and put up and maintained at all times during the night or daytime, around all open ditches, trenches, excavations, or other work potentially dangerous to pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Barricades shall be placed on all sides and throughout the entire length of all open ditches, trenches, excavations, or other work which must be barred to the general public. Barricades shall be properly painted in order to retain a high degree of visibility at all times to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
