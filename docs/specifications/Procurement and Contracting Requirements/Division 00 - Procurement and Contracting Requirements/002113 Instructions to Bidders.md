Any Subcontractor, Supplier, individual, or entity so listed and against which Owner and Engineer makes no written objection prior to the giving of the Notice of Award will be deemed acceptable to Owner and Engineer subject to revocation of such acceptance after the Effective Date of the Agreement as provided in paragraph 6.06 of the General Conditions.

The seminar and the workshop will be conducted by a neutral facilitator at a time and location agreed to by Owner and Contractor in the general vicinity of the Site.
03. The facilitator will be selected by Owner, subject to approval by Contractor. Costs of the facilitator and facilities for the initial seminar and workshop will be paid by Owner.

04. It is intended that the initial seminar and workshop sessions be followed by periodic half-day evaluation sessions approximately every 90 days as agreed to by Owner and Contractor.
