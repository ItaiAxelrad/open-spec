   1. Each and all items of the Fire Alarm System shall be listed as a product of “SimplexGrinnell” as the fire alarm system manufacturer under the appropriate category by Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. (UL), and shall bear the "U.L." label. All control equipment shall be listed under UL category UOJZ as a single control unit. There will be no substitutions, and partial listing shall NOT be acceptable. In addition to the UL-UOJZ requirement mentioned above, the system controls shall be UL listed for Power Limited Applications and all circuits must be marked in accordance with NEC article 760-23.

   1. The system shall be provided with sufficient standby capacity to operate the entire system upon loss of normal 120 VAC power in a normal supervisory mode for a period of twenty-four (24) hours with 5minutes of alarm operation at the end of this period. The system shall automatically transfer to the standby power source upon power failure. All battery charging and recharging operations shall be automatic.
   1. All external circuits requiring system operating power shall be 24VDC and shall be individually fused at the control panel.
   1. This fire alarm system shall be compatible in everyway with the system already existing at NREL.
   1. Doors in firewalls are specified under other sections of the specifications to have magnetic holding devices. The Contractor shall integrate these devices so as to de-activate the magnets and allow the doors to swing closed in the event of a fire alarm. 
   1. FIRE ALARM CONTROL PANEL - MODEL 4120-8001
   1. Control Panel 
   1. Construction shall be modular with solid state, microprocessor based electronics. It shall display only those primary controls and displays essential to operation during a fire alarm condition. Keyboards or keypads shall not be required to operate the system during fire alarm conditions.
   1. A local audible device shall sound during Alarm, Trouble or Supervisory conditions. This audible device shall sound differently during each condition to distinguish one condition from another without having to view the panel. This audible device shall also sound during each keypress to provide an audible feedback to ensure that the key has been pressed properly.
   1. Primary Keys, LED's and LCD Display
   1. The Control Panel shall have a 2 line x 40-character liquid crystal display that shall be backlit for enhanced readability. So as to conserve battery standby power, it shall not be lit during an AC power failure unless an alarm condition occurs or there is keypad activity.
   1. The display shall support both upper and lower case letters. Lowercase letters shall be used for softkey titles and prompting the user. Uppercase letters shall be used for System Status Information. A cursor shall be visible when entering information.
   1. System Point Capacity
   1. Point capacity shall support any combination of 99,000 addressable monitor or control points, e.g., all points can be monitor, all points can be control, or any combination of monitor and control.

   1. Network must be a true peer-to-peer network. Capability to view network information from any node. System must have style 7-network signaling.
   1. SYSTEM PANEL OPERATION AND CAPABILITIES
   1. The system alarm operation subsequent to the alarm activation of any manual station, automatic detection device, or sprinkler flow switch shall be as follows:
      1. A digitized emergency signal shall be transmitted to all horns zones activated for that alarm. 
   1. All visible alarm indicating appliances shall flash continuously until the system is reset. The strobes shall flash at the rate of once per second and all strobes at the same instant. This shall be accomplished in a UL listed manner.
   1. All audible indicating appliances shall operate in a general alarm mode. 
   1. Any subsequent zone alarm shall reactivate the alarm indicating appliances.
   1. The fire alarm control panel shall control and communicate with nodes through a serial data interface. This shall allow for distributed processing of alarm input and output functions. 
   1. The alarm shall be displayed on an 80-character LCD display. The top line of 40 characters shall be the point label and the second line shall be the device type identifier. The system alarm LED shall flash on the control panel until the alarm has been acknowledged. Once acknowledged, this same LED shall latch on. A subsequent alarm received from another zone shall flash the system alarm LED on the control panel. The LCD display shall show the new alarm information.
   1. The system will monitor the smoke detection operation of the system sensors to provide "two stage" operation. When an individual smoke sensor senses smoke at a 0.2%/0.5% or 1% obscuration level (desired level will be indicated for each device by the Owner) a supervisory notice shall be generated. This condition shall cause a message to be shown on the control panel indicating the need for investigation of this condition. This operation is designed to provide staff with the opportunity to investigate situations where very low amounts of smoke are generated, e.g., a smoldering fire condition that typically takes a long time to develop. When the sensor level reaches its programmed alarm level, 2.5% obscuration typical, the normal system alarm sequence will take place.
   1. The system shall support the same multi-stage operation when used with heat sensors, e.g., a software selectable level for supervisory notification and a higher, alarm-causing temperature level.
   1. The control panel shall have a dedicated supervisory service LED and a dedicated supervisory service acknowledge switch for the annunciation and acknowledgement of sprinkler supervisory functions (OS&Y, PIV, etc.). 
   1. History Logging
   1. The system shall be capable of logging and storing 600 events in an alarm log and 600 events in a trouble log. These events shall be stored in a battery protected random access memory. Each recorded event shall include the time and date of that event's occurrence.
   1. Audible Walk-test
   1. The system shall be capable of being tested by one person. When in the walk test mode the system shall announce the zone being tested or the digital address of the device being tested as each device or zone is activated. System shall announce that testing is completed when system is returned to normal.
   1. Silent Walk-test with History Logging
   1. While in this testing mode the alarm activation of an initiating device circuit shall be silently logged as an alarm condition in the historical data file. The panel shall automatically reset itself after logging of the alarm.
   1. Visual Walk-test with History Logging
   1. While in a testing mode the activation of any initiating device will cause the system visual devices to flash in response to that activation. Visuals shall flash twice each time a device is activated. A separate visual indication shall be provided for activation of trouble conditions or supervisory conditions. 
   1. Provide the alarm, severe weather, and all clear messages in English. Provide these messages in either a male or a female voice, or both, as the Contracting Officer directs.
   1. MULTIPLE ADDRESSABLE PERIPHERAL NETWORK (IDNET)
   1. Communication with addressable devices. The system must provide communication with initiating and control devices individually. All of these devices will be individually annunciated at the control panel.
   1. All addressable devices shall have the capability of being disabled or enabled individually.
   1. Up to 250 addressable devices may be multi-dropped from a single pair of wires. Systems that require factory reprogramming to add or delete devices are unacceptable.
   1. Format
   1. The communication format must be a completely digital poll/response protocol to allow t-tapping of the circuit wiring. A high degree of communication reliability must be obtained by using parity data bit error checking routines for address codes and check sum routines for the data transmission portion of the protocol. Systems that do not utilize full digital transmission protocol are not acceptable.
   1. Device Replacement
   1. Both smoke and heat sensors must be able to be changed by the Owner without the need to set addresses or perform other technical tasks to accomplish sensor changes. This requirement is to decrease long-term maintenance costs as well as ensuring that the Owner can utilize non-technical staff to change, for example, a dirty sensor in a timely fashion.
   1. Note:
      1. When a heat sensor is installed in a base programmed as a smoke sensor the system will initiate a trouble condition but will allow the heat detector to operate normally in this location. This functionality allows the Owner to remove smoke detectors and install heat detectors in their place during periods of construction.
