1. EXECUTION
1. COORDINATION
   1. Coordinate size and location of concrete bases. Cast anchor-bolt inserts into bases. Concrete, reinforcement, and formwork requirements are specified in Division 3.
   1. Coordinate installation of roof curbs, equipment supports, and roof penetrations. These items are specified in Division 7.
1. INSTALLATION
   1. Comply with NECA 1 and NECA 101 for application of hangers and supports for electrical equipment and systems except if requirements in this Section are stricter.
   1. In first paragraph below, support spacings in NECA 1, Table 1, are more detailed and specific and generally stricter than those permitted by NFPA 70 for EMT, IMC, and RMC. Revise to suit Project, and consider retaining reference to NECA table for critical projects.
   1. Maximum Support Spacing and Minimum Hanger Rod Size for Raceway:
      1. Space supports for EMT, IMC, and RMC as required by NFPA 70. Minimum rod size shall be 1/4 inch (6 mm) in diameter.
   1. Multiple Raceways or Cables:
      1. Install trapeze-type supports fabricated with steel slotted or other support system, sized so capacity can be increased by at least 25 percent in future without exceeding specified design load limits.
   1. Secure raceways and cables to these supports with single-bolt conduit clamps using spring friction action for retention in support channel.
   1. Retain paragraph below for projects where seismic design requirements do not apply. Consider retaining for light-commercial projects only.
   1. Spring-steel clamps designed for supporting single conduits without bolts may be used for 1-1/2-inch (38-mm) and smaller raceways serving branch circuits and communication systems above suspended ceilings and for fastening raceways to trapeze supports.
1. SUPPORT INSTALLATION
   1. Consult structural engineer for requirements in this Article.
   1. Comply with NECA 1 and NECA 101 for installation requirements except as specified in this Article.
   1. Retain first paragraph below to permit raceways running perpendicular to bar joists and trusses to be supported by letting them rest within the joist or truss openings. NECA 1 does not mention this method. If seismic design requirements apply, consult structural engineer or authorities having jurisdiction before permitting this support method and specify seismic requirements in Division 26 Section "Vibration And Seismic Controls For Electrical Systems."
   1. Raceway Support Methods:
      1. In addition to methods described in NECA 1, conduit may be supported by openings through structure members, as permitted in NFPA 70.
   1. Strength of Support Assemblies:
      1. Where not indicated, select sizes of components so strength will be adequate to carry present and future static loads within specified loading limits. Minimum static design load used for strength determination shall be weight of supported components plus 200 lb (90 kg).
   1. Mounting and Anchorage of Surface-Mounted Equipment and Components:
      1. Anchor and fasten electrical items and their supports to building structural elements by the following methods unless otherwise indicated by code:
      1. To Wood:
         1. Fasten with lag screws or through bolts.
   1. To New Concrete:
      1. Bolt to concrete inserts.

   1. Instead of expansion anchors, powder-actuated driven threaded studs provided with lock washers and nuts may be used in existing standard-weight concrete 4 inches (100 mm) thick or greater. Do not use for anchorage to lightweight-aggregate concrete or for slabs less than 4 inches (100 mm) thick.

   1. Coordinate paragraphs and subparagraphs below with Sections specifying supported equipment.
   1. Construct concrete bases of dimensions indicated but not less than 4 inches (100 mm) larger in both directions than supported unit, and so anchors will be a minimum of 10 bolt diameters from edge of the base.
   1. Unless otherwise specified in Division 3, use 3000-psi (20.7-MPa), 28-day compressive-strength concrete. Concrete materials, reinforcement, and placement requirements are specified in related Division 3 Sections of the Specifications. 
   1. Anchor equipment to concrete base.
   1. Place and secure anchorage devices. Use supported equipment manufacturer's setting drawings, templates, diagrams, instructions, and directions furnished with items to be embedded.
   1. Install anchor bolts to elevations required for proper attachment to supported equipment.
   1. Install anchor bolts according to anchor-bolt manufacturer's written instructions.
1. PAINTING
