1. EXECUTION
1. WORK PRIOR TO COMMISSIONING
   1. Complete all phases of work so the system can be energized, started, tested, and otherwise commissioned. The Divisions 26, 27 and 28 Contractors have primary start-up responsibilities with obligations to provide, install and test complete systems, including all sub-systems so they are functional. This includes the complete installation of all equipment, materials, raceways, wire, terminations, controls, etc., per the Contract Documents and related directives, clarifications, change orders, etc.
   1. The commissioning plan, developed by the CA, is an attachment to these specifications. Upon request of the CA, this Contractor shall provide assistance and consultation in updating the plan to reflect actual installed equipment. If system modifications or clarifications are incorporated to this and related sections of work, commissioning of this work will be made at no additional cost to the Owner. If Contractor-initiated system changes have been made that alter the commissioning process, the CA will notify the Architect, and the Contractor may be obligated to compensate the CA to test the revised product.
   1. Specific pre-commissioning responsibilities of Divisions 26, 27 and 28 include, but are not limited to the following:
      1. Normal start-up services required to bring each system into a fully operational state. This includes motor rotational check, cleaning, lug tightening, control sequences of operation, etc. The CA will not begin the commissioning process until each system is complete, including normal contractor start-up and debugging.
   1. The Contractor shall complete pre-functional checklists for and functional testing of the equipment and systems to be commissioned as described in the Commissioning Plan including, but not limited to the systems shown below:
      1. Life safety systems
   1. Standby power system
   1. Lighting control systems
   1. Factory start-up services will be provided for key equipment and systems specified in Divisions 26, 27 and 28. This Contractor shall coordinate this work with the manufacturer and the CA.
   1. Commissioning is intended to begin upon completion of a system. Commissioning may proceed prior to the completion of systems and/or sub-systems, if expediting this work is in the best interests of the Owner. Commissioning activities and schedule will be coordinated with the Contractor. Start of commissioning before system completion will not relieve the Contractor from completing those systems as per the schedule.
1. PARTICIPATION IN COMMISSIONING
   1. Provide skilled technicians to start-up, debug, and functionally test all systems within the division of work. These same technicians shall be made available to assist the CA in completing the commissioning program as it relates to each system and their technical specialty. Work schedules, time required for testing, etc., will be requested by the CA and coordinated by the Contractor. Contractor will ensure the qualified technician(s) are available and present during the agreed-upon schedules and of sufficient duration to complete the necessary tests, adjustments, and/or problem resolutions.
   1. System problems and discrepancies may require additional technician time, CA time, redesign and/or reconstruction of systems, and system components. The additional technician time shall be made available for the subsequent commissioning periods until the required system performance is obtained.
   1. The CA reserves the right to judge the appropriateness and qualifications of the technicians relative to each item of equipment, system, and/or sub-system. Qualifications of technicians include expert knowledge relative to the specific equipment involved, adequate documentation and tools to service/commission the equipment, and an attitude/willingness to work with the CA to get the job done. A liaison or intermediary between the CA and qualified factory representatives does not constitute the availability of a qualified technician for purposes of this work.
1. WORK TO RESOLVE DEFICIENCIES
   1. In some systems, misadjustments, misapplied equipment, and/or deficient performance under varying loads will result in additional work being required to commission the systems. This work will be completed under the direction of the Architect, with input from the Contractor, equipment supplier, and CA. Whereas all members will have input and the opportunity to discuss, debate, and work out problems, the Owner’s Representative will have final jurisdiction on the necessary work to be done to achieve performance.
   1. Corrective work shall be completed within the allotted time on the construction schedule. Experimentation to correct system performance will be permitted. If the CA deems the experimentation work to be ineffective or untimely as it relates to the commissioning process, the CA will notify the Architect/Engineer indicating the nature of the problem, expected steps to be taken, and the deadline for completion of activities. If the deadline(s) passes without resolution of the problem, the Owner reserves the right to obtain supplementary services and/or equipment to resolve the problem. Costs incurred to solve the problems in an expeditious manner will be the Divisions 26, 27 and 28 Contractor’s responsibility.
1. ADDITIONAL COMMISSIONING
   1. Additional commissioning activities may be required after system adjustments, replacements, etc., are completed. The Contractor, suppliers, and CA shall include a reasonable time reserve to complete this work as part of their standard contractual obligations.
1. RECOMMISIONING
   1. After the initial and peak seasoning commissioning is completed, there may be additional work required to serve new or revised loads. This work is not part of the contract.
1. TRAINING
   1. This Contractor will be required to participate in the training of the Owner's engineering and maintenance staff for each mechanical system and the related components as described in other sections of these specifications. Training will be conducted in a classroom setting, with system and component documentation, and suitable classroom training aids, or in the field with the specific equipment.
   1. Training will be conducted jointly with the CA, the design engineers, the equipment vendors, and the Contractor. The Division 26, 27 and 28 Contractors will be responsible for the generic training, as well as instructing the Owner's staff on the system peculiarities specific to this project.
1. SYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION
   1. In addition to the requirements of Division 1, update Contract Documents to incorporate field changes and revisions to system designs to account for actual constructed configurations. All drawings shall be red-lined on two sets. Divisions 26, 27 and 28 as-built drawings shall include updated architectural floor plans, and the individual electrical systems in relation to actual building layout.
   1. Maintain as-built red-lines on the job site as required in Division 1. Given the size and complexity of this project, red-lining of the drawings at completion of construction, based on memory of key personnel, is not satisfactory. Continuous and regular red-lining and/or posting of drawings is considered essential and mandatory.
   1. In addition to the stated requirements for operation and maintenance data, provide one copy of equipment technical literature, operation and maintenance literature, and shop drawings to the CA as soon as they are available. This requirement is for review of these documents prior to distribution of multiple copies for the Owner's final use.
