## General

:
      1. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to consult the Engineer and Engineering Drawings and Details so as to thoroughly familiarize himself with the type and quality of construction to be provided on this project.
   1. The Electrical Drawings are diagrammatic in nature and do not show every connection in detail or every line or conduit in its exact location. These details are subject to the requirements of all codes and ordinances as well as all structural and Engineer conditions. The Contractor shall carefully investigate structural and finish conditions and shall coordinate
the separate trades in order to avoid interference between the various phases of work. Work shall be laid out so that it will be concealed in furred chases unless specifically noted or indicated to be exposed. Work shall be installed to avoid crippling of structural members; therefore, inserts to accommodate conduit hangers shall be set before concrete is poured, and proper openings through floors, walls, beams, etc. shall be provided as hereinafter specified or as otherwise indicated or required before concrete is poured. All work shall be run parallel or perpendicular to the lines of the building unless otherwise noted.
   1. The approximate location of electrical items is indicated on the Electrical Drawings. Exact locations are to be determined by actual field measurements and will in all cases be subject to the approval of the Engineer. The Engineer reserves the right to make any reasonable changes in the indicated locations prior to installation for no additional cost.
09. TEMPORARY SERVICES

Regardless of any information contained in the Shop Drawings, the requirements of the Contract Documents shall govern and are not waived or superseded in any way by the submittal data review.
   1. Before submission of Shop Drawings and Brochures, the Contractor shall certify that each Shop Drawing and each item of material or equipment complies with the Contract Documents for this Project. Such certification shall be made by the Owner, a Partner, a Corporate Officer of the Contractor, or by a person duly authorized to sign for the Contractor. Unless so certified, Shop Drawings and/or Brochures will be returned for resubmittal. Certifications shall be in the form of rubber stamp impressions or typed letter
