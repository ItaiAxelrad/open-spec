5. OCCUPANCY SENSORS

[A.] Ceiling-mounting Units: Unit receives control power from a separately mounted auxiliary power and control unit, and operates power switching contacts in that unit.

[A.] Ceiling-mounting Units: Unit receives 24V dc power from a remote source and, on sensing occupancy, closes contacts that provide signal input to a remote microprocessor-based lighting control system.
   1. Switch-Box-Mounting Units:
      1. Unit receives power directly from the switch leg of the 120- or 277-VAC circuit it controls and operates integral power switching contacts rated 800W at 120-VAC, and 1,200W at 277-VAC, minimum.
   1. Operation:
      1. Turns lights on when room or covered area is occupied and off when unoccupied, unless otherwise indicated.
1. Time Delay for Turning Lights Off:
      1. Adjustable over a range from 1 to 30 minutes, minimum.
2. Manual Override Switch:

4. Isolated Relay Contact:
      1. Operates on detection of occupancy or vacancy, as indicated, to activate an independent function.
5. Suitable for control of the load type (incandescent, low-voltage, or fluorescent), load capacity, and branch circuit voltage of the lighting fixtures controlled.

      1. As follows:
      1. Relays rated for a minimum of 20-amp normal ballast load or 13-amp tungsten filament or high-inrush ballast load.
2. Sensor Power Supply:
      1. Rated to supply the number of connected sensors.

[E.] Passive-Infrared Type: Detects occupancy by a combination of heat and movement in zone of coverage. Each sensor detects occupancy in the sensor's zone of coverage by detecting occurrence of 6-inch (150-mm) minimum movement of any portion of a human body that presents a minimum target of 36 square inches (232 square cm) to the sensor.

[E.] Daylight Filter: Passive-infrared sensor shall incorporate daylight filter to minimize affects of visible light interference.

[E.] Ultrasonic Type: Emits a beam of ultrasonic energy and detects occupancy through use of Doppler's principle in discerning movement in zone of coverage by sensing a change in pattern of reflected ultrasonic energy.

[E.] Dual-Technology Type: Uses a combination of passive-infrared and ultrasonic detection methods to distinguish between occupied and unoccupied conditions for area covered. Particular technology or combination of technologies that controls each function (on or off) is selectable in the field by operating controls on unit.
