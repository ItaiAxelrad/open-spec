Sweep bends may be made up of one or more curved or straight section or combinations thereof. Manufactured bends shall have a minimum radius of 18 inches for use with conduits of less than three inches in diameter and a minimum radius of 36 inches for ducts of three inches in diameter and larger . Excavate trenches along straight lines from structure to structure before ducts are laid or structure constructed so the elevation can be adjusted, if necessary, to avoid unforeseen obstructions.
   1. Duct Bank:
      1. Terminate conduits in end-bells where duct lines enter underground structures. Stagger conduit joints by rows and layers to strengthen the duct bank.

Before pouring concrete, anchor duct bank assemblies to prevent the assemblies from floating during concrete pouring. Anchoring shall be done by driving reinforcing rods adjacent to every other duct spacer assembly and attaching the rod to the spacer assembly. As each section of a duct line is completed from structure to structure, for conduit sizes three inches and larger draw a flexible testing mandrel approximately 12 inches long with a diameter less than the diameter of the conduit through the conduit. After which, draw a stiff bristle brush having the same diameter of the conduit through the conduit, until the conduit is clear of particles of earth, sand, and gravel; then immediately install end plugs.
   1. Cable Pulling

Pull cables down grade with the feed-in point at the manhole or buildings of the highest elevation. Use flexible cable feeds to convey cables through manhole opening and into duct runs. Accumulate cable excess as indicated in the Staking Drawings at each manhole or junction box where space permits by training cable around the interior to form one complete loop. Maintain minimum allowable bending radii in forming such loops. Maintain the specified cable bending radii when installing under all conditions, including turn ups into switches, transformers, and oilier enclosures. Cable with tape or wire shield shall have a bending radius not less than 12 times the overall diameter of the completed cable. If basket-grip type cable-pulling devices are used to pull cable into place, cut off the section of cable under the grip before splicing and terminating.

   1. Cables in Manholes, Handholes, and Vaults:
      1. Do not install cables utilizing the shortest route, but route along those walls providing the longest route and maximum spare cable lengths. Form cables to closely parallel walls, not to interfere the duct entrances, and support on brackets and cable insulators at a maximum of four feet. In existing manholes, handholes and vaults where new ducts are to be terminated or where new cables are to be installed, locate the existing installation of cables, cable supports and grounding as required for a uniform installation with cables carefully arranged and supported. Install cables at middle and bottom of cable racks, leaving top space open for future cables, except as .otherwise indicated for existing installations. Provide one spare three-insulator rack arm for each cable rack in each underground structure.
   1. Cable Terminating

Install terminations of insulated power cables in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements. Make terminations with materials and methods as indicated or specified herein or as designated by the written instruction of the cable manufacturer and termination kit manufacturer.
1. Field Quality Control
