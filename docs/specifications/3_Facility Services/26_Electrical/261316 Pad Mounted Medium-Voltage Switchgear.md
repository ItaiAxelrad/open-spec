Pad-mounted equipment shall be installed on concrete pads in accordance with the manufacturers published, standard installation drawings and procedures, except that they shall be modified to meet the requirements of this document. Units shall be carefully installed so as not to damage equipment or scratch painted or coated surfaces. After installation, surfaces shall be inspected and scratches touched up with a paint or coating provided by the manufacturer especially for this purpose. Three phase transformer installations shall be installed with A, B, C phase sequence. Primary taps shall be set at tap to produce nominal secondary voltage.
1. SWITCHGEAR AND TRANSFORMER PADS
   1. Exact pad dimensions and mounting details are equipment specific and are the responsibility of the Contractor. Tops of pads shall be level and shall project 4 inches above finished grade and sloped to drain. Conduits for primary and grounding conductors shall be set in place prior to placement of pads. To facilitate cable installation and termination, the pads shall be provided with a rectangular hole below the primary and secondary compartments as indicated, and sized in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended dimensions.
   1. Bases under switches shall provide 20 inches vertically for cable terminations under the switches. The slab shall be of adequate size to project at least eight inches beyond the equipment. Where grounding electrode conductors are installed through concrete pads, PVC conduit sleeves shall be installed through the concrete to provide physical protection.
1. SEALING
   1. When the installation is complete, the Contractor shall seal all conduit and other entries into the equipment enclosure with an approved sealing compound. Seals shall be of sufficient strength and durability to protect all energized live parts of the equipment from rodents, insects, or other foreign matter. Cut off and bush conduits three inches above the slab surface.
1. PADLOCKS
   1. Padlocks by shall be provided by the Owner for pad-mounted equipment and transformers.
1. IDENTIFICATION
   1. Provide engraved plastic-laminate signs, per related Division 26 sections of the Specifications, located on the front of each component, indicating equipment, voltages and source.
1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Field Tests
   1. Prepare for acceptance tests as follows:
      1. Test insulation resistance for each switchgear bus, component, connecting supply, feeder, and control circuit.
   1. Test continuity of each circuit.
   1. Manufacturer's Field Service:
      1. Engage a factory-authorized service representative to perform the following:
      1. Inspect switchgear, wiring, components, connections, and equipment installation and test and adjust components and equipment.
   1. Assist in field testing of equipment, including pretesting and adjusting of automatic power factor correction units.
   1. Report results in writing.
   1. Testing Agency:
      1. Owner will engage a qualified independent testing and inspecting agency to perform field tests and inspections and prepare test reports.
   1. Perform the following field tests and inspections and prepare test reports:
      1. Perform each electrical test and visual and mechanical inspection stated in NETA ATS. Certify compliance with test parameters. Perform NETA tests and inspections for each of the following NETA categories:
         1. Switchgear.
   1. Circuit breakers.
   1. Protective relays.
   1. Instrument transformers.
   1. Metering and instrumentation.
   1. Ground-fault systems.
   1. Battery systems.
   1. Surge arresters.
   1. Capacitors.
   1. Remove and replace malfunctioning units and retest as specified above.
   1. Infrared Scanning:
      1. After Substantial Completion, but not more than 60 days after Final Acceptance, perform infrared scan of each switchgear. Remove front and rear panels so joints and connections are accessible to portable scanner.
   1. Follow-up Infrared Scanning:
      1. Perform an additional follow-up infrared scan of each switchgear 11 months after date of Substantial Completion.
   1. Instrument:
      1. Use an infrared-scanning device designed to measure temperature or to detect significant deviations from normal values. Provide calibration record for device.
   1. Record of Infrared Scanning:
      1. Prepare a certified report that identifies switchgear checked and that describes infrared-scanning results. Include notation of deficiencies detected, remedial action taken and observations after remedial action.
