   1. Suspended Lighting Fixture Support:
      1. Pendants and Rods:
         1. Where longer than 48 inches (1200 mm), brace to limit swinging.
   1. Stem-Mounted, Single-Unit Fixtures:
      1. Suspend with twin-stem hangers.
   1. Continuous Rows:
      1. Use tubing or stem for wiring at one point and tubing or rod for suspension for each unit length of fixture chassis, including one at each end.
   1. Adjust aimable lighting fixtures to provide required light intensities.
   1. Light Leaks 
   1. Assemble and install lighting fixtures to prevent light leaks at any visible ports, seams, and joints of the lighting fixture, which are not designed or intended as lighting output surfaces or areas. 
   1. Install flush-mounted lighting fixtures to prevent light leaks from between the lighting fixture assembly and the surface in which the lighting fixture is recessed. 
   1. Identification 
   1. Provide a neat, visible, permanent red dot marking, nominally 3 mm (1/8 inch) in diameter, on lighting fixtures indicated or specified for life safety lighting. Locate dot on outside corner of the door frame of lighting fixtures with a lens or louver frame, or on the end plate or other suitable and normally visible metal housing of the lighting fixtures without doors. This marking is not required on lighting fixtures expressly dedicated and recognizable for emergency use, such as exit signs. 
   1. Field Quality Control 
   1. Field Tests 
   1. Test for Emergency Lighting:
      1. Interrupt power supply to demonstrate proper operation. Verify transfer from normal power to battery and retransfer to normal.
   1. Prepare a written report of tests, inspections, observations, and verifications indicating and interpreting results. If adjustments are made to lighting system, retest to demonstrate compliance with standards.
   1. Conduct burn-in test by operating lighting fixtures between 100 and 120 hours. Replace defective lamps and lamps which burn out during the burn-in period with new lamps.
   1. Test each lighting fixture and lighting fixture accessory for proper functional and operational performance. Report and immediately correct all deficiencies as they arise. Provide complete documentation of all tests, inspections, and adjustments.
   1. Lamp Seasoning
   1. Burn-in lamps controlled by dimming ballast for 100 hours at full intensity prior to any dimming.
   1. Cleaning 

## General


   1. Clean interior surfaces of lighting fixtures of dirt and construction debris upon completion of installation. Clean fingerprints, smudges, and other marks from lenses, louvers, and reflecting surfaces. Leave free of visible marks.
   1. Adjusting 

## General


   1. Adjust the lamp socket position in downlight lighting fixtures per the manufacturer's recommendations for the specified lamp type and voltage. Optimize the lighting output of the lighting fixture by properly locating the light center within the reflector.
   1. Upon final completion of the installation of the lighting fixtures and any associated lighting control systems, notify the Contracting Officer in writing to arrange for the final adjustment and aiming of lighting equipment requiring aiming and adjustment.
   1. In cooperation with the Contracting Officer, aim and adjust lighting equipment after dark. Provide all necessary experienced labor, tools, and equipment. Provide sufficient sessions for aiming and adjusting until all lighting fixtures and systems are properly aimed and adjusted to achieve the desired lighting effects to the Contracting Officer’s satisfaction.
