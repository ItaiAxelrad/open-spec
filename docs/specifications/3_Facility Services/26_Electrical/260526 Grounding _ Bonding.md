Test completed grounding system at each location where a maximum ground-resistance level is specified (3 Ohms or less), at service disconnect enclosure grounding terminal, and at ground test wells. Measure ground resistance not less than two full days after the last trace of precipitation, and without the soil being moistened by any means other than natural drainage or seepage and without chemical treatment or other artificial means of reducing natural ground resistance. Perform tests, by the fall-of-potential method according to IEEE 81.
1. Excessive Ground Resistance:
   1. If resistance to ground exceeds specified values, notify
   1. Engineer promptly and include recommendations to reduce ground resistance.
