## Execution

1. Underground Piping Installation
   1. Trench Excavation:
      1. Excavate trenches so that piping may be laid correctly on line and grade. Remove any large rocks or other debris encountered in the excavation and dispose of appropriately.
   1. Excavate to a sufficient depth and width to provide adequate room for construction and installation of the work except that the width of the trench from the pipe invert to a point 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall not be greater than 30 inches.
   1. Where it is impossible to maintain proper line and grade, excavate below grade and replace the bedding with compacted sand.
   1. Excavation for Structures:
   1. Make excavation for structures such as manholes, sumps, interceptors and basins, to the depth required for pouring or placing the base slab. Whenever possible, rest the base on the natural surface of the excavation with a minimum amount of compacted sand-cement mixture to be used for leveling. In no case will more than 3 inches of sand-cement mixture be permitted under a base slab and if ground conditions or excess excavation causes need for more than 3 inches of fill or leveling course; provide sand fill, compacted in place.
   1. Excavate for a structure only wide enough to allow proper mortaring or pointing of joints or wide enough for forms which may be necessary.
   1. Sheeting, Bracing, and Shoring:
   1. Provide and maintain sheeting, bracing and shoring required to provide substantial support for the sides of excavations and trenches to prevent movement of the soil or edges of the trench, to protect the construction work and insure the safety of the workmen.
   1. As the trench is backfilled, remove supports in such a manner as to prevent the caving in of the sides of the trench or damage to the pipe or structures.
   1. Underpinning:
      1. Where excavation work is required under or adjacent to existing footings, under-pin as required to adequately support existing construction in such a manner as to avoid raising or lowering or otherwise damaging existing construction.
   1. Removal of Water:
      1. Keep excavations as dry as possible until backfill has been completed above the pipe. In ground containing excessive amount of water, provide and maintain such pumps and associated pipes and connections as are necessary to remove the water from the trench and assure safe, proper construction of the piping system.
   1. Bedding:
   1. Provide Class "B" bedding for piping inside the building, consisting of a layer of granular material with a minimum thickness of 4 inches and a maximum thickness of 6 inches below the bottom of the pipe barrel. Extend the bedding to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of the pipe.
   1. Place sand-gravel cover in 6-inch layers, mechanically compacted to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557.
   1. Firmly support a given segment of the bottom of the pipe. The segment, as a minimum, shall be equal to five-tenths of the outside diameter of the barrel, and shall be uniformly supported by direct contact with firm bedding. Excavate bell holes at proper intervals so that no part of the load on the pipe is supported by the bells.
   1. Pipe Laying:
   1. Lay piping only in filled or disturbed earth after it has been compacted to properly support general construction.
   1. Lay pipe in dry and clean trenches.
   1. Inspect pipe and fittings for defects prior to being lowered into the trench and clean both inside of the bell and outside of the spigot.
   1. Lay pipe lines straight and in true alignment with the grade and location established.
   1. Backfilling:
   1. Place and compact backfill so that subsequent harmful settlement will not occur and the installation of concrete floor slabs may proceed after completion. Begin backfilling as required at the bedding of the pipe and continue vertically to the surface.
   1. Do not commence backfilling prior to inspection of the pipe. After inspection, place the sand required above the pipe and proceed with the backfilling operation.
   1. Provide sand backfill mechanically compacted in 6-inch lifts to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557, for all piping inside the building.
   1. Pipes Through Grade Beams:
      1. Provide pipes and tubing passing through or under building grade beams with a schedule 40 pipe sleeve with 4-inch clearance to prevent possible damage from building settlement.
1. Aboveground Piping Installation\* 1. General:
   1. Make changes in direction for chemical waste and vent piping using appropriate branches, bends, and long-sweep bends. Sanitary tees and short-sweep 1/4 bends may be used on vertical stacks if change in direction of flow is from horizontal to vertical. Use long-turn, double Y-branch and 1/8-bend fittings if 2 fixtures are installed back to back or side by side with common drain pipe. Straight tees, elbows, and crosses may be used on vent lines. Do not change direction of flow more than 90 degrees. Use proper size of standard increasers and reducers if pipes of different sizes are connected. Reducing size of drainage piping in direction of flow is prohibited.
   1. Install pipe and pipe fittings in accordance with recognized industry practices to achieve permanently leakproof systems, capable of performing the indicated service without failure.
   1. Install each piping run with a minimum number of joints and couplings but with adequate and accessible unions/flanges for disassembly and maintenance/replacement of valves and equipment.
   1. Install piping with sufficient clearance from other piping, building structure and other systems to allow for the piping insulation to be properly applied.
   1. Run piping above ground parallel with the lines of the building unless otherwise shown or noted.
   1. Keep horizontal runs of piping as high as possible to provide maximum head room.
   1. Install piping in equipment rooms so as not to interfere with aisleways and to allow unhindered egress from any point in the space.
   1. Keep vertical lines straight in the partitions or furring or as close to the columns as possible.
   1. Run pipe to avoid interference with ducts, wires or apparatus and with approved offsets around columns, beams and other obstructions.
   1. Install piping that penetrates a vapor retarder to respect the vapor retarder integrity by sealing the opening around the pipe with vapor retardant tape.
   1. Install piping with sufficient clearance from building structural members so as not to interfere with the application of steel fireproofing.
   1. Establish piping elevations prior to installation to avoid interferences with other piping and materials and equipment of other trades.
   1. Personnel Protection from Suspended Work:
      1. See Division 1 sections of the Specifications for requirements.
   1. Pitching of Piping:
      1. Install chemical waste and vent piping at the following minimum slopes, unless otherwise indicated:
         1. Chemical Waste:
      1. 2 percent downward in direction of flow for piping NPS 3 and smaller; 1 percent downward in direction of flow for piping NPS 4 and larger.
   1. Vent Piping:
      1. 1 percent down toward vertical fixture vent or toward vent stack.
