   1. Sectioning/Preassembly:
      1. 
   1. If high purity piping jobs are to be preassembled ahead of the certified solder/brazer, no more than 1 day’s work will be preassembled, and all high purity piping will be maintained under purge as at all times. Under NO circumstances will preassembled pipe and fittings be allowed to be carried into the next day’s effort.
   1. If any job is not completed at the end of the normal work day, all open pipe or valve ends will be capped with suitable caps, capable of maintaining a 2 to 5 lbs positive pressure, or left with a continuous UHP purge until job is completed. Upon completion of a job, the entire line will be left with a positive pressure of 5 to 10 lbs on line.
   1. Tube and Component Handling:
      1. All materials shall be handled and stored throughout the progress of the job, so as to prevent contamination. Open ends of all tubes, fittings, valves, etc., shall be kept bagged and taped until final connections are made. Wood, cloth plugs, and tape on or in open ends, are not acceptable and shall not be used. Compression fittings may be used to cap or plug sections of lines at the end of each work day as long as they do not become a part of the system. Damage to the tubing must be cut away if compression fittings are put to such use.
   1. All material that becomes contaminated in handling shall not be reused but shall be segregated from the new material. If the system, or parts of the system, becomes contaminated due to fabrication, the Contractor must replace the system at the Contractor’s expense.
   1. No pounding or hammering on any joints or components shall be performed to force parts into alignment of move into place.
   1. Brazing:
      1. Brazed joints shall be kept as far as possible from threaded joints and valve seats. In all cases, the distance shall be sufficient to prevent the heat of brazing from destroying the effective seal of joint tapes or valve seats. All brazed joints that show evidence of overheating, cracking, poor penetration, or other defects of fit-up or workmanship shall be replaced.
   1. During brazing, all gas lines must be continuously purged with ultra high purity (UHP) nitrogen or argon gas supplied by the Contractor, and allowed to escape to the atmosphere through a purge restrictor such as a perforated cap. For each purge restrictor used, a minimum flow of 300 lph purge is required. In all cases use sufficient purge gas to prevent oxidation, and to carry off vapors.
   1. Make sure tube and fittings are clean and in good condition as specified in the Materials section. Before cutting out a section of tubing from a length of tubing, a portion on each side of the tube—of sufficient length to be a joint area—must be cleaned and polished on each side of the intended cut off point before the cut is made.
   1. Insert tube into full depth of fitting. Support the tubing and fitting as necessary to keep their axis straight and in line and to maintain equal clearance around the tubing the fitting to permit uniform capillary action.
   1. When silver soldering, apply flux sparingly to external joint area. Flux must be kept at proper consistency for fluxing. Particular care must be taken in application to avoid getting or leaving any flux inside the completed joint. An oxy-acetylene torch is to be used for soldering or brazing.
   1. For silver soldered joints, wash outside of joint with water to remove all traces of flux residue after soldering. For copper brazed joints, clean outside of joint with an abrasive material to remove any black traces (do not wash).
   1. A test joint must be fabricated at the beginning of each day and after any change in operations. Test joints must be fabricated and tested in compliance with the Inspection and Testing Section of this document.
   1. Tighten all valve gland nuts after assembly.
   1. Threaded:
      1. All threaded fittings (e.g., NPT) must be factory manufactured and cleaned. No on-the-job threading of fittings is allowed. Fittings connectors must be round, true, and new. Threaded joints shall be kept at absolute minimum. All Connections shall be leak free. Teflon tape is allowed on threaded fittings, but not pipe dope. Connections must be firmly tightened, but not over tightened to obtain part alignment.

      1. All valve handles to be turned down when installed horizontally above ceiling and perpendicular (away) from the wall when installed on along vertically along a wall.
   1. Service Drops:
      1. Unless otherwise specified, all gas services that have service drops (point-of-use termination, run-outs to the tool drop, etc.), shall terminate with a line valve, regulator, check valve, control valve, and 1/2" Male NPT connector (plugged). The termination level (of the 1/2" MNPT connector) shall be 10' above finished floor to allow for flexible installation of equipment under the service drop.
   1. Capping and Plugging
   1. If any job is not completed at the end of the normal work day, all open pipe or valve ends will be capped with suitable caps to maintain a 2 to 5 lbs positive pressure of UHP argon or nitrogen overnight, or left with a continuous purge until job is completed. Any completed job will be left with a positive pressure of 5 to 10 lbs of UHP argon or nitrogen on the line upon sealing.
   1. Compression fittings may be used to cap or plug sections of lines at the end of each work day as long as they do not become a part of the system. Damage to the tubing must be cut away if compression fittings are put to such use.
   1. Prior to certification, all valves shall be opened and all tube lines shall be blown out using ultra high purity nitrogen or argon to remove all foreign mater that may have accumulated in the tubes. Lines shall be blown-out by progressively opening and closing valves.
   1. Inspection and Testing:
      1. Test Joints:
         1. All installers shall fabricate a test braze or solder joint at the beginning of each day and after any change in operations (e.g., changing a gas cylinder or head on the brazing equipment). Test joints shall then be sawed in half and torn apart to reveal the soundness of the joint, and proper penetration. Should testing or inspection reveal unsound soldered or brazed joints test joints shall be made until the process is rectified and the contractor is confident all subsequent joints will be of adequate quality. All test joints must be numbered and dated and kept until each line (and all test joints from that installation) is inspected by the owner.
   1. Visual Inspections:
      1. No pounding or hammering on any joints or equipment shall be performed to test installation integrity. All systems must be visually inspected to ensure that they comply with design drawings. Documentation of all component specification must be verified to ensure they meet requirements; including pressure and temperature ratings. Joints and components must be visually inspected to ensure proper external cleanliness and line integrity.
   1. Leak Testing:
      1. All joints are to be tested with bubble leak detecting solution. Test shall start at 60-100 psig pressure in order to reveal large magnitude leaks. The test gas shall be UHP argon or nitrogen. Leaks shall be repaired under purge. Once the line passes the low pressure test, the pressure shall be raised to 200 psig and maintained for 24 hours (after being valved off from the source gas) with no more than a 5 psig pressure loss. Any noncompensated pressure loss will be cause for rejection.
   1. Performance Certification:
      1. All piping shall be certified to meet the following maximum requirements after purge and prior to acceptance:
      1. Moisture content < 2 ppm

Sleeves shall be standard width pipe of sufficient length to pass through the entire thickness of the partition and shall be cut flush with each surface, except as otherwise specified. All tubing passing through metal partitions shall be fitted with expanded in-place metal sleeves except as otherwise specified.
   1. Tubing shall be supported using plastic or neoprene coated clevis hangers or copper plated Unistrut clips. In areas where there may be danger of equipment damage to tubing (e.g., loading docks where forklifts may operate), channels shall be constructed to protect the tubing from physical damage.
   1. Underground tubing installations shall not be shallower than 3’ below ground. Backfill material shall consist of sand and shall be free of rocks an stones. Cinders shall not be used. Backfill shall be packed in layers not to exceed 9” in thickness.

A log book must be kept that specifies the operator's name, date and duration of use, any adjustments or tip changes made, and measurements of sample welds specifying the weld gap, sample weld undercut, face reinforcement, weld root concavity, and root reinforcement. Sample welds are required at the start of any project, repeated at the beginning of each work day for an ongoing project, and after any adjustment of the weld gap or weld head components. Sample test pieces may either be butt welds of stainless steel tubing or ATW-tubing welds.
   1. Sample welds are destructively tested when the production welds will be in toxic or highly toxic gas distribution lines not in secondary containment. Destructive testing is performed by sawing the tube lengthwise in half through the weld and filing or grinding as necessary to remove sawing burrs and distortions. The weld is visually checked for depth and penetration, joint contamination, joint soundness, surface oxidation and discoloration. Measurements taken from the sample are recorded in the log book. Each sample weld is inspected visually, with the unaided eye, following the guidelines outlined below and AWS D10.9-80 .
   1. Each sample weld is inspected visually prior to assembly of the test pieces, to ensure that the proper materials are being used, that the parts have been cleaned, and that the end preparation is correct. Each sample weld is inspected visually after fit-up, to check the joint clearances, as per manufacturers specifications. Each sample weld is inspected visually during welding for cracks, porosity, undercut, incomplete fusion, surface roughness, and poor crater conditions.
   1. Each sample weld bead is inspected as-deposited and after any normal mechanical operations such as brushing, filing, or grinding, prior to depositing subsequent passes. Grinding may be used when necessary on starts and stops and to remove local defects from bead-to-bead, but dressing of the complete sample weld is limited to the removal of weld reinforcement. If production welding is done from the outside of the pipe only, no repair of the root of the sample weld from the inside of the pipe is permitted.
   1. Each sample weld is inspected visually after welding has been completed, to detect any surface defects. This includes ensuring that the specified base metal and filler metal have been used, that the weld is free of cracks, that all craters are filled to the full cross section of the weld and are free of cracks upon completion of the welding, that the face of the weld is at least flush with the outside surface of the pipe, and that the weld merges smoothly with the base metal. The depth of weld undercut shall not exceed 1/32”, irrespective of length. The weld reinforcement shall not exceed 3/32” along the face.
   1. The root of the weld is examined to ensure complete joint penetration and that there are no cracks or incomplete fusion. A concave root surface is permitted so long as the total weld thickness is equal to or greater than that of the base metal, the maximum root surface concavity is 1/32”, and the maximum root reinforcement is 1/16”.
   1. The AWS D10.9-80 guideline for undercut (1/32” recess from outer face of tubing) is used to determine acceptability of welds not destructively tested.
   1. During orbital tube welding, all gas lines must be continuously purged with ultra high purity (UHP) argon or argon/hydrogen mix as supplied by the Contractor, and allowed to escape to the atmosphere through a purge restrictor such as a perforated cap. For each purge restrictor used, a minimum flow of 300 lph purge is required. In all cases use sufficient purge gas to prevent oxidation, and to carry off vapors.
   1. Make sure tube and fittings clean and in good condition as specified in the Materials section.
   1. Insert tube full depth into weld head so there is flush meeting of the two ends being welded. Support the tubing and fitting as necessary to keep their axis straight and in line and to maintain equal clearance around the tubing the fitting to permit a uniform weld.
   1. Valves:
      1. All valve handles to be turned down when installed horizontally above ceiling and perpendicular (away) from the wall when installed on along vertically along a wall.
   1. Service Drops:
      1. All house gas services that have service drops (point-of-use termination, run-outs to the tool drop, etc.), shall terminate with a line valve, regulator, check valve, control valve, and 1/2" male VCR connector (capped). Exceptions may be specified by end users. The level of the 1/2" VCR connector shall be 10' above finished floor to allow for flexible installation of equipment under the service drop.
   1. Capping and Plugging:
      1. If any job is not completed at the end of the normal work day, all open pipe or valve ends will be capped with suitable caps to maintain a 2 to 5 lbs positive pressure of UHP argon or nitrogen overnight, or left with a continuous purge until job is completed. Any completed job will be left with a positive pressure of 5 to 10 lbs of UHP argon or nitrogen on the line upon sealing. VCR caps and plugs are the preferred means of sealing lines.
   1. Compression fittings may be used to cap or plug sections of lines at the end of each work day as long as they do not become a part of the system. Damage to the tubing must be cut away if compression fittings are put to such use.
   1. Prior to certification, all valves shall be opened and all tube lines shall be blown out using ultra high purity nitrogen or argon to remove all foreign mater that may have accumulated in the tubes. Lines shall be blown-out by progressively opening and closing valves.
   1. Inspection and Testing:
      1. Sample Welds:
         1. All installers shall fabricate a sample weld at the start of any project, repeated at the beginning of each work day for an ongoing project, and after any adjustment of the weld gap or weld head components as per the orbital tube welding section of this document. All sample welds must be numbered and dated and kept until each line (and all test joints from that installation) is inspected by the owner.
   1. Visual Inspections:
      1. No pounding or hammering on any joints or equipment shall be performed to test installation integrity. All systems must be visually inspected to ensure that they comply with design drawings. Documentation of all component specification must be verified to ensure they meet requirements; including pressure and temperature ratings. Joints and components must be visually inspected to ensure proper external cleanliness and line integrity.
   1. Each weld shall be inspected visually after welding has been completed, to detect any surface defects. This includes ensuring that the specified base metal and filler metal have been used, that the weld is free of cracks, that all craters are filled to the full cross section of the weld and are free of cracks upon completion of the welding, that the face of the weld is at least flush with the outside surface of the pipe, and that the weld merges smoothly with the base metal. The depth of weld undercut shall not exceed 1/32” irrespective of length. The weld reinforcement shall not exceed 3/32” along the face.
   1. Leak Testing:
      1. 100% of all orbital tube welds are leak checked. The integrity of all welds and connections must be both inboard and outboard leak tested. 
   1. An inboard leak test is performed by evacuating the line and introducing helium at all connections, valves, joints, welds, and fittings, while monitoring mass spectrometer (mass spec.) to detect any helium that may enter the line. The leak rate must not exceed 5 x 10-8 sccm of helium. The leak detector must be capable of detecting a leak slower than of 5 x 10-8 sccs of helium by testing the detector with a helium leak standard of known value before testing the line in order to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly.
   1. An outboard leak test – pressure decay method is performed by pressuring a line to the maximum achievable pressure (at least 1.5 times the normal operating pressure), and then isolating the line from the pressure source. The line is then held at pressure for a minimum of 24 hours and the maximum pressure loss is 5 psig pressure loss over a 24 hour period at 1.5 times normal operating pressure.
   1. Performance Certification:
      1. All piping shall be certified to meet the following maximum requirements after purge and prior to acceptance:
      1. Moisture content < 2 ppm
   1. Oxygen contents < 2 ppm
   1. Hydrocarbons < 1 ppm
   1. Particulates < 10 particles/ft3
   1. Labeling:
      1. Use Brady labels or equivalent in compliance with NREL policy. Each service drop must have a label and label disc inserted in valve handle. Labels shall identify gas in each tube, plus, header location and column number. Labeling shall be placed on tubing every 10 feet on straight tube runs, before and after valves, and before and after breaching walls and partitions. Tubing 1/2 inch or larger requires labels having print at least 1/2 inch in height.
   1. Line Protection:
      1. For highly toxic and pyrophoric gases, all tubing outside of gas cabinets shall be enclosed in a ventilated chase or race way (see Division 23 sections of the Specifications) providing secondary containment, with this ventilated volume being monitored for the appropriate HPM. For house services such as hydrogen, secondary containment is not required for continuous tubing runs (i.e., all joints welded and no valves, couplings, regulators, etc.) within the laboratory or HPM source rooms.
   1. All tubing passing through masonry partitions shall be fitted with pipe sleeves. Sleeves shall be standard width pipe of sufficient length to pass through the entire thickness of the partition and shall be cut flush with each surface, except as otherwise specified. All tubing passing through metal partitions shall be fitted with expanded in-place metal sleeves except as otherwise specified.
   1. Tubing shall be supported using plastic or neoprene coated clevis hangers or copper plated Unistrut clips. In areas where there may be danger of equipment damage to tubing (e.g., loading docks where forklifts may operate), channels shall be constructed to protect the tubing from physical damage.
   1. Underground tubing installations shall not be shallower than 3 feet below ground. Backfill material shall consist of sand and shall be free of rocks an stones. Cinders shall not be used. Backfill shall be packed in layers not to exceed 9 inches in thickness. Each layer shall be compacted by hand or machine tampers, or by other suitable means, to a density that will prevent excessive shrinkage or settlement. Early warning tape will be installed 12 inches above the physical location of the tubing during backfilling. Backfill shall be brought to a suitable elevation above grade to provide for anticipated settlement or shrinkage.

   1. Excavate to a sufficient depth and width to provide adequate room for construction and installation of the work except that the width of the trench from the pipe invert to a point 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall not be greater than 30 inches. 
   1. Where it is impossible to maintain proper line and grade, excavate below grade and replace the bedding with compacted sand. 
   1. Sheeting, Bracing, and Shoring:
      1. 
   1. Provide and maintain sheeting, bracing and shoring required to provide substantial support for the sides of excavations and trenches to prevent movement of the soil or edges of the trench, to protect the construction work and insure the safety of the workmen. 
   1. As the trench is backfilled, remove supports in such a manner as to prevent the caving in of the sides of the trench or damage to the pipe or structures. 
   1. Underpinning:
      1. Where excavation work is required under or adjacent to existing footings, under-pin as required to adequately support existing construction in such a manner as to avoid raising or lowering or otherwise damaging existing construction. 
   1. Removal of Water:
      1. Keep excavations as dry as possible until backfill has been completed above the pipe. In ground containing excessive amount of water, provide and maintain such pumps and associated pipes and connections as are necessary to remove the water from the trench and assure safe, proper construction of the piping system. 
   1. Bedding:
      1. 
   1. Provide Class "B" bedding for piping inside the building, consisting of a layer of granular material with a minimum thickness of 4 inches and a maximum thickness of 6 inches below the bottom of the pipe barrel. Extend the bedding to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of the pipe. 
   1. Place sand-gravel cover in 6-inch layers, mechanically compacted to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557. 
   1. Firmly support a given segment of the bottom of the pipe. The segment, as a minimum, shall be equal to five-tenths of the outside diameter of the barrel, and shall be uniformly supported by direct contact with firm bedding. Excavate bell holes at proper intervals so that no part of the load on the pipe is supported by the bells. 
   1. Pipe Laying:
      1. Lay piping only in filled or disturbed earth after it has been compacted to properly support general construction. 
   1. Lay pipe in dry and clean trenches. 
   1. Inspect pipe and fittings for defects prior to being lowered into the trench and clean both inside of the bell and outside of the spigot. 
   1. Lay pipe lines straight and in true alignment with the grade and location established. 
   1. Install cast iron storm, sub-surface drain collector and sanitary drainage systems in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
   1. Backfilling:
      1. 
   1. Place and compact backfill so that subsequent harmful settlement will not occur and the installation of concrete floor slabs may proceed after completion. Begin backfilling as required at the bedding of the pipe and continue vertically to the surface. 
   1. Do not commence backfilling prior to inspection of the pipe. After inspection, place the sand required above the pipe and proceed with the backfilling operation. 
   1. Provide sand backfill mechanically compacted in 6-inch lifts to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557, for all piping inside the building. 
   1. Pipes Through Grade Beams:
      1. Provide pipes and tubing passing through or under building grade beams with a schedule 40 pipe sleeve with 4-inch clearance to prevent possible damage from building settlement.
