1. EXECUTION
1. ERECTION INSTALLATION APPLICATION
   1. Installation of Thermometers:
      1. Install thermometers in vertical and tilted positions to allow reading by observer standing on floor.
   1. Install as shown on plans.
   1. Thermometer Wells:
      1. Install in piping where thermometers are indicated in vertical position. Fill well with temperature conduction grease, oil, or graphite and secure cap.
   1. Installation of Pressure Gauges:
      1. Mechanical Spaces:
         1. Install pressure gauges in piping with pressure gauge located at most readable position. Extend fittings as needed to make gauge readable to plant operators. Gauges not readable by an observer standing on floor are unacceptable and will be relocated at the contractor’s expense.
   1. Finished Spaces:
      1. Pressure gauges installed above dropped ceilings will face down or be located at the most readable position for service personnel.
   1. Extend gauge piping to allow for insulation. Gauge shutoff valves must be operable after insulation is installed. Install in the following locations and elsewhere as indicated:
      1. Across suction and discharge of each pump.
   1. Differential pressure (DP) gauge assemblies:
      1. DP gauges assemblies will be installed across the suction and discharge of pumps. The DP gauge shall have 1/4-inch ball valves on the pump suction and discharge connections. Connecting fittings shall be 1/4 inch NPT. (Valves and fittings may match port size on pumps with factory equipped gauge port taps.) A snubber shall be installed on the gauge to reduce gauge needle oscillations.
   1. Installation of Flow Measuring Elements and Meters:

## General

:
         1. Install gauges and thermometers in piping systems located in accessible locations at most readable position.
   1. Locations:
      1. Install flow measuring elements and meters where indicated. Single turbine flow meters require 40 pipe diameters of straight pipe ahead of the flow element. Consult the manufacturer's recommendations for installing dual turbine flow meters.
1. ADJUSTING
   1. Adjust faces of meters and gauges to proper angle for best visibility.
1. CLEANING
   1. Clean windows of meters, gauges and factory finished surfaces. Replace cracked or broken windows; repair scratched or marred surfaces with manufacturer's touch-up paint.
