## Execution

1. INSTALLATION
	1. General:
   1. Examine rough-in requirements for equipment having to verify actual locations of piping connections prior to installation.
   1. Examine walls, floors, roofs, and plumbing chases for suitable conditions where piping and specialties are to be installed.
   1. Piping shall be run true, plumb, and straight, with all restraints adjusted to carry their proportional load and locked to prevent pipe “wag,” misalignment, movement, shear, or sagging.
   1. Use fittings for all changes in direction and all branch connections.
   1. Install exposed piping at right angles or parallel to building walls. Diagonal runs are not permitted unless expressly indicated.
   1. Install piping free of sags or bends with ample space between piping to permit proper insulation applications. Piping hanger spacing and supports shall be per Code requirements (minimum) or per Division 22 sections of the Specifications, whichever is more stringent.
   1. Conceal all pipe installations in walls, pipe chases, utility spaces, above ceilings, below grade or floors unless indicated to be exposed to view.
   1. Install piping tight to slabs, beams, joists, columns, walls, and other permanent elements of the building. Allow sufficient space above removable ceiling panels to allow for panel removal.
   1. Fire Barrier Penetrations:
      1. Where pipes pass through fire-rated walls partitions, ceilings, and floors, maintain the fire-rated integrity. Use fire-stop caulking materials at all fire-rated wall penetrations.
   1. Provide for pipe expansion and seismic braces as required by the contract documents and/or jurisdictional authority.
   1. All copper tube and fitting shall be reamed and buffed prior to soldering or brazing.
   1. The use of solder containing lead is prohibited.
   1. Refer and conform to the “Copper Development Association” instructions for proper preparation and actual installation practice for all soldered and brazed joints.
   1. Laboratory Vacuum Piping

## General

   1. Pitch all mains back to the central system and provide valved drain pockets and drain cocks at all low points and trapped sections in the system.
   1. Connect all branches to the top of mains. Valve all risers and branches.
   1. Use Y or TY fittings where tees are shown in the drawings. (2 ½” and larger).
   1. Cleanouts:
      1. Install full size cleanouts at the each of each main and branch and wherever pipe changes direction or otherwise requires cleanouts for proper cleaning of the entire vacuum system. Cleanout can be accomplished by using tees instead of elbows or double Y or TY fittings.
   1. Valves and Specialties
   1. Provide unions or flanges wherever necessary and in piping at all equipment so that piping may be conveniently broken and moved to facilitate equipment maintenance.
   1. Provide isolation valves on all lines before they leave the utility corridor and at each floor level.
1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL

## General

 Testing Procedures:
      1. All piping systems shall be tested and proven tight prior to concealment. The test shall be witnessed by the Architect/Engineer, plumbing inspector, or the Owner’s representative.
   1. Insure that the test pressure that might damage fixtures or equipment does not reach such units by valving them off or otherwise isolating them during the test.
