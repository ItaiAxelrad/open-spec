## EXECUTION

1. UNDERGROUND PIPING INSTALLATION
   1. Trench Excavation
   1. Excavate trenches so that piping may be laid correctly on line and grade. Remove any large rocks or other debris encountered in the excavation and dispose of appropriately.
   1. Excavate to a sufficient depth and width to provide adequate room for construction and installation of the work except that the width of the trench from the pipe invert to a point 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall not be greater than 30 inches.
   1. Where it is impossible to maintain proper line and grade, excavate below grade and replace the bedding with compacted sand. 
   1. Excavation for Structures 
   1. Make excavation for structures such as manholes, sumps, interceptors and basins, to the depth required for pouring or placing the base slab. Whenever possible, rest the base on the natural surface of the excavation with a minimum amount of compacted sand-cement mixture to be used for leveling. In no case will more than 3 inches of sand-cement mixture be permitted under a base slab and if ground conditions or excess excavation causes need for more than 3 inches of fill or leveling course; provide sand fill, compacted in place. 
   1. Excavate for a structure only wide enough to allow proper mortaring or pointing of joints or wide enough for forms which may be necessary. 
   1. Sheeting, Bracing, and Shoring 
   1. Provide and maintain sheeting, bracing and shoring required to provide substantial support for the sides of excavations and trenches to prevent movement of the soil or edges of the trench, to protect the construction work and insure the safety of the workmen. 
   1. As the trench is backfilled, remove supports in such a manner as to prevent the caving in of the sides of the trench or damage to the pipe or structures. 
   1. Underpinning 
   1. Where excavation work is required under or adjacent to existing footings, under-pin as required to adequately support existing construction in such a manner as to avoid raising or lowering or otherwise damaging existing construction. 
   1. Removal of Water 
   1. Keep excavations as dry as possible until backfill has been completed above the pipe. In ground containing excessive amount of water, provide and maintain such pumps and associated pipes and connections as are necessary to remove the water from the trench and assure safe, proper construction of the piping system. 
   1. Bedding 
   1. Provide Class "B" bedding for piping inside the building, consisting of a layer of granular material with a minimum thickness of 4 inches and a maximum thickness of 6 inches below the bottom of the pipe barrel. Extend the bedding to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of the pipe. 
   1. Place sand-gravel cover in 6-inch layers, mechanically compacted to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557. 
   1. Firmly support a given segment of the bottom of the pipe. The segment, as a minimum, shall be equal to five-tenths of the outside diameter of the barrel, and shall be uniformly supported by direct contact with firm bedding. Excavate bell holes at proper intervals so that no part of the load on the pipe is supported by the bells. 
   1. Pipe Laying 
   1. Lay piping only in filled or disturbed earth after it has been compacted to properly support general construction. 
   1. Lay pipe in dry and clean trenches. 
   1. Inspect pipe and fittings for defects prior to being lowered into the trench and clean both inside of the bell and outside of the spigot. 
   1. Lay pipe lines straight and in true alignment with the grade and location established. 
   1. Install cast iron storm, sub-surface drain collector and sanitary drainage systems in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
   1. PVC DWV Pipe
   1. Install PVC DWV underground plastic drainage piping in strict accordance with ASTM D2321.
   1. Comply with the procedures in ASTM F402 for safe handling during joining of plastic pipe and fittings with solvent cements.
   1. Sanitary and Storm Drain Piping
   1. Install cast-iron soil piping according to CISPI's "Cast Iron Soil Pipe and Fittings Handbook," Chapter IV, "Installation of Cast Iron Soil Pipe and Fittings."
   1. Encase underground piping with PE film according to ASTM A 674 or AWWA C105.
   1. Make changes in direction for soil and waste drainage and vent piping using appropriate branches, bends, and long-sweep bends. Do not change direction of flow more than 90 degrees. Use proper size of standard increasers and reducers if pipes of different sizes are connected. Reducing size of drainage piping in direction of flow is prohibited.
   1. Lay buried building drainage piping beginning at low point of each system. Install true to grades and alignment indicated, with unbroken continuity of invert. Place hub ends of piping upstream. Install required gaskets according to manufacturer's written instructions for use of lubricants, cements, and other installation requirements. Maintain swab in piping and pull past each joint as completed.
   1. Install soil and waste drainage and vent piping at the following minimum slopes, unless otherwise indicated:
      1. Building Sanitary Drain:
         1. 2 percent downward in direction of flow for piping NPS 3 and smaller; 1 percent downward in direction of flow for piping NPS 4 and larger.
   1. Horizontal Sanitary Drainage Piping:
      1. 2 percent downward in direction of flow.
   1. Vent Piping:
      1. 1 percent down toward vertical fixture vent or toward vent stack.
   1. Bedding and filter 
   1. Place graded aggregate and filter bedding, minimum 6 inches in depth, on the filter fabric which has been placed on compacted subgrade. Place aggregate filter about 6 inches thick around the tile, prior to wrapping the tile and aggregate filter with filter fabric. Lap filter fabric end 12 inches on top of the pipe and along the pipe length at the joints of the fabric. Rest each section of pipe firmly upon the bedding, through the entire length, with recess formed for bell joints. 
   1. Filter screen
   1. Provide filter screen to retain filter aggregate at end of the pipe. Filter screen:
      1. 12-inch-wide band of stainless steel fabric having 1/8-inch openings, wrapped and tied securely with wire around the end of the drain pipe systems at the high point.
   1. Pipe laying 
   1. Lay drain lines to true grades and alignment, with a continuous fall in the direction of flow. Face bells of pipe sections upgrade. Clean interior of pipe thoroughly before being laid. When drain lines are left open for connection to discharge line, temporarily close the open ends and mark the location with wooden stakes. Lay perforated pipe with perforations facing down. Remove and re-lay any length that has had its grade or joints disturbed. 
   1. Backfilling 
   1. Place and compact backfill so that subsequent harmful settlement will not occur and the installation of concrete floor slabs may proceed after completion. Begin backfilling as required at the bedding of the pipe and continue vertically to the surface. 
   1. Do not commence backfilling prior to inspection of the pipe. After inspection, place the sand required above the pipe and proceed with the backfilling operation. 
   1. Provide sand backfill mechanically compacted in 6-inch lifts to 95 percent of maximum density as determined by ASTM D1557, for all piping inside the building. 
   1. Pipes Through Grade Beams 
   1. Provide pipes and tubing passing through or under building grade beams with a schedule 40 pipe sleeve with 4-inch clearance to prevent possible damage from building settlement.
