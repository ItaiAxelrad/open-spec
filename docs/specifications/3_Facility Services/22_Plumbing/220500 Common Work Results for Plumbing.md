   1. Installation:
      1. Identification of Piping:
            1. Identify all piping according to the following procedures:
         1. Bare pipes to be marked shall first be wiped clean of dirt, dust, grease, and moisture. Markers to be installed on painted piping shall be applied only after completion of final coat of paint. Insulated pipes shall first be painted to a smooth, hard surface in the area the label is to be applied. Labels shall be applied, using pressure, so that it lies smooth and flat. After application on insulated pipes, the label shall be stapled securely to the insulation. The labels shall be applied to the pipe so that the lettering is in the most legible position. For overhead piping apply markers on the lower half of the pipe where view is unobstructed, so that markers can be read at a glance from floor level. The wording on the labels shall correspond directly to the wording in the mechanical symbol lists, regardless of whether or not it is standard wording for the designated manufacturer.
   1. Use an arrow marker with each pipe content marker. The arrow shall always point away from the pipe marker and in the direction of flow, with background color and height the same as content marker. If flow can be in both directions, use two arrow markers.
   1. Apply pipe marker and arrow marker at each valve, at every point of pipe entry or exit through wall or ceiling, on each riser and branch of tee, and every 20 feet on long continuous lines or at every bay or aisle to show proper identification of pipe content and direction of flow.
   1. Valves:
      1. All main service valves, including fire protection, located inside the building shall be tagged and identified as to the type of service. All valves controlling branch mains or risers to various portions of the building shall be tagged and identified as to the areas served.
   1. Controls:
      1. All automatic controls, control panels, zone valves, pressure electric, electric pressure switches, relays and starters shall be clearly tagged and identified. Wording shall be identical to that on the control diagram in the contract drawings.
   1. Pumps:
      1. All pumps shall be identified as to service with aluminum or brass tags secured by tie wires.
   1. Concrete Bases:
      1. Construct concrete equipment bases of dimensions indicated, but not less than 4 inches larger in both directions than supported unit. Follow supported equipment manufacturer's setting templates for anchor bolt and tie locations. Use 3000 psi, 28-day compressive strength concrete and reinforcement as specified in Division 3. Housekeeping pads under pumps, etc., shall be 3-1/2A inches thick with #4 reinforcing bars 12 inches on center each way unless otherwise noted.
   1. Erection of Metal Supports and Anchorage:
      1. Cut, fit, and place miscellaneous metal supports accurately in location, alignment, and elevation to support and anchor mechanical materials and equipment.
