   1. On all indoor and outdoor applications, on hot piping systems, apply a vapor sealing joint sealer, 1/16-inch-thick to all butt and longitudinal joints of the outer layer of multi-layered installations and to all circumferential and longitudinal joints of single layer installations. Apply joint sealer so as to completely fill the thickness of the joints. Do not bond layers of insulation to each other; avoid applying excessive sealer in the joints and do not feather edge. 
   1. On all indoor and outdoor applications, on ambient and cold piping systems, apply a vapor sealing joint sealer, in full bed coverage (not a bead), for sealing all joints of insulation and pvc slip joints of the vapor barrier type, moisture and water resistant, 97 percent solids by weight, non-hardening and flexible with a service temperature range from -50 degrees F to 200 degrees F; Childers “CP-76”, Foster “44” or “95-50” or as approved.

Install the reinforcing cloth so as to be completely covered with the mastic and ensure that there are no cracks, holes, thin spots or open joints in the vapor barrier. Allow the vapor barrier to dry per manufacturer’s instructions before application of jacketing.
   1. Check the vapor barrier for final dry thickness, continuity, cracks, thin spots, pinholes, etc. Repair unsatisfactory areas.

1. AMBIENT AND COOLED EQUIPMENT APPLICATION
	1. For Elastomeric Insulation (on ambient and cold equipment only)
   1. Apply sheet insulation over all surfaces without stretching. 
   1. Cover all devices on tanks and heat exchangers with mitered sections of insulation so as to facilitate their servicing and removal without disturbing the equipment insulation. 
   1. If sheet insulation is not provided with a factory-applied contact adhesive, then apply sheet insulation with the smooth or skin side out. Adhere insulation with complete coverage of adhesive. Apply a thin but adequate coat on both surfaces to be joined. Allow the adhesive films to air-dry until dry to touch but tacky under slight pressure before joining surfaces. Avoid open time in excess of 20 minutes. Apply moderate pressure to entire areas, insuring complete contact. Since adhesive is an instant-bonding type, position surfaces accurately as contact is made. Apply adhesive at temperatures above 40 degrees F. Do not apply to heated surfaces or to insulation over heated surfaces. Allow adhesive joints applied with full adhesive bonding to dry for 7 days before applying solvent-base finishes. 
   1. Ensure that metal surface is clean and dry and free of all dirt, scale, loose paint, plaster, oil, etc. 
   1. If the metal surface has been primed, apply adhesive with a brush to a test area approximately 2-square-feet to determine whether the solvent in the adhesive will loosen or lift the primer. If there is any indication of loosening or lifting the primer, do not apply insulation until primer has been removed and re-applied properly. 
   1. Do not apply insulation over asphaltic surfaces. 
   1. Provide adhesives that are compatible with the insulation employed.
   1. Apply adhesive to the surface to be insulated with brush or short-nap paint roller, covering enough area to receive one sheet of insulation. 
   1. Apply adhesive to the back of the sheet with brush or short-nap paint roller, leaving 1/2-inch-wide, uncoated border around the perimeter of the sheet. 
   1. Allow the adhesive to dry to the touch before bringing the two surfaces into contact. 
   1. Position the sheet in such manner that it overlaps the edges of the previously installed sheet or sheets by 1/8 inch. While held in this position, spot-adhere the center of the sheet. Compress the butt edges into place to achieve a tight joint. Bond the remainder of the sheet by pressing firmly into place. 
   1. Spread the joint and, by means of a small brush, apply adhesive to both butt edges - do not fill joint with adhesive. No open time is required for this adhesive application; however, align the butt edges for good appearance. 
   1. Stagger the vertical joints where sheet insulation is applied to vertical tanks. In the case of horizontal tanks, stagger the horizontal joints.
   1. If insulation with a self-adhering back is employed, wipe all surfaces with an alcohol soaked damp rag before applying sheet.

   1. Where the operating temperature exceeds 180 degrees F, seal the end terminations with a brush coat of silicone sealant.
   1. Install pvc valve and flange covers in the same manner as the pipe jacketing, using extra long pvc covers to allow for bolt removal clearance.
   1. Ambient and Cold Piping and Equipment
   1. Ensure that the insulation vapor barrier is properly sealed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and the surface of the vapor barrier is perfectly dry before applying the pvc jacket.
   1. Do not install jacketing system with an ambient temperature under 35 degrees F.
   1. Install the pvc jacketing with matching one-piece pvc fitting covers. Provide the jacketing cut and precurled with longitudinal self-sealing lap tape over the properly sealed vapor barrier jacket. Overlap the circumferential seams by 2 inches.

   1. Do not apply mastics when the ambient temperature is, or is expected to be in the next 24 hours, below 340 degrees F unless specifically approved for that use by the manufacturer.
   1. Cut all openings in the metal jacketing for nozzles, brackets, protrusions, etc. as close as possible to achieve a tight fit. Use silicone or butyl based caulking compounds to seal all projections and penetrations.
   1. Piping 
   1. Provide a minimum of 2-inch overlap on all circumferential and longitudinal joints. Locate the longitudinal lap on horizontal piping alternatively at either the ten o’clock or two o’clock position to shed rainwater.
