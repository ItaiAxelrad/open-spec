1. 2.2 General
   1. Blowers shall be of the rugged, industrial-duty, regenerative type, designed with maintenance-free, single or dual stage dynamics, free of contacting moving parts other than the motor ball bearings and shaft seal.
2. Blowers shall be designed for continuous industrial service, delivering clean air, free of oils or any other “contaminants”.
1. 2.3 Blower Construction
   1. Blower impeller shall be of one-piece, solid, radial-blade type.
2. Blower housing shall be of one-piece construction to assure proper perpendicularity and clearances for the precision-machined impeller.
3. Blower housing cover shall be of one-piece construction and precision-machined to assure perfect fit to the blower housing cover surface.
4. Blower impeller, housing, cover and acoustical integral manifold cavity shall be of rugged, superior cast ability and ductility, aluminum alloy, inherently resistant to corrosion and sparking. All aluminum castings shall have Chem Tough™ applied for protection from chemical elements.
5. Alternate materials and material surface conversion coating finishes, shall be used as required to meet specific corrosive atmospheres - not satisfactorily met by standard materials and finishes.
6. Sealed Blowers - The blower will be equipped with a Teflon shaft seal in a stainless steel casing, vacuum impregnated castings to eliminate material porosity, and sealed with a high temperature anaerobic type sealant.
7. The blower inlet and outlet threaded flanges shall be of cast iron construction to resist stripping of threads.
	1. Soft metals such as aluminum are not acceptable.
	2. Flanges shall be Nickel plated.
8. All hardware shall be stainless steel. Plated hardware shall not be acceptable.
	1. Motors
9. Integrally mounted, direct-drive, motors shall be NEMA frame.
	1. The motor ball bearings shall be permanently sealed and B10 Life rated for 15,000 hours of continual maintenance-free operation.
10. The blower shall be designed for the proper plant classification:
	1. Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled (TEFC).
11. Voltage, frequency and phase tolerances shall be as required for efficiency of operation in accordance with system electrical parameters.
12. Nameplate Amps
	1. TEFC Motors shall be capable of carrying full rated load continuously with a temperature rise not exceeding 100°C above an ambient temperature of 40°C, and be designed with a minimum of Class F rated insulation and bearing grease. These motors will be rated as Class F.
13. Service Factor
	1. TEFC Motors shall be with a 1.15 SF.
14. Motors shall be designed to meet applicable U.L. and CSA standards.
	1. Blower Filter

	1. Filters shall be of low pressure drop design utilizing an 8 to 10 micron or finer element.
	2. Filter elements shall be polyester with a metal wrapped screen.
	3. A foam pre-filter is to be used to remove larger particulate prior to entering filter.
16. Construction:
	1. Welded sheet and plate steel construction. Metal joints are sealed to prevent dirt and air from bypassing the filter element.
	2. Surfaces are prime coated, followed with a final coat of manufacturer’s standard finish.
	3. Connection to be threaded or flanged. Threaded connections shall be NPT, while flanges are matched to 125 lb. ANSI Flanges.
