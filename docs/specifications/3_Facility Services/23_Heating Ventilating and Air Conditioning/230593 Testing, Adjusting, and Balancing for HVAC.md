   1. Adjust supply fan to maximum design airflow with the variable-airflow controller set at maximum airflow.
   1. Set terminal units being tested at full-airflow condition.
   1. Adjust terminal units starting at the supply-fan end of the system and continuing progressively to the end of the system. Adjust inlet dampers of each terminal unit to design airflow.
