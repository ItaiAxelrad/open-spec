When the total airflow of all terminal units is more than the fan design airflow volume, place a selected number of terminal units at a maximum set-point airflow condition until the total airflow of the terminal units equals the design airflow of the fan. Select the reduced airflow terminal units so they are distributed evenly among the branch ducts.

   19. Select the terminal unit that is most critical to the supply-fan airflow and static pressure. Measure static pressure. Adjust system static pressure so the entering static pressure for the critical terminal unit is not less than the sum of the terminal unit manufacturer's recommended minimum inlet static pressure plus the static pressure needed to overcome terminal-unit discharge duct losses.
   20. Measure total system airflow. Adjust to within 10 percent of design airflow.
   21. Set terminal units at maximum airflow and adjust controller or regulator to deliver the designed maximum airflow.

   32. Set supply fan at minimum airflow if minimum airflow is indicated. Measure static pressure to verify that it is being maintained by the controller.
   33. Set terminal units at minimum airflow and adjust controller or regulator to deliver the designed minimum airflow. Check air outlets for a proportional reduction in airflow as described for constant-volume air systems.
   34. If air outlets are out of balance at minimum airflow, report the condition but leave the outlets balanced for maximum airflow.
   35. Measure the return airflow to the fan while operating at maximum return airflow and minimum outside airflow. Adjust the fan and balance the return-air ducts and inlets as described for constant-volume air systems.
   36. Pressure-Dependent, Variable-Air-Volume Systems with Diversity:
      6. After the fan systems have been adjusted, adjust the variable-air-volume systems as follows:
      7. Set system at maximum design airflow by setting the required number of terminal units at minimum airflow. Select the reduced airflow terminal units so they are distributed evenly among the branch ducts.
   37. Adjust supply fan to maximum design airflow with the variable-airflow controller set at maximum airflow.
   38. Set terminal units being tested at full-airflow condition.
   39. Adjust terminal units starting at the supply-fan end of the system and continuing progressively to the end of the system. Adjust inlet dampers of each terminal unit to design airflow. When total airflow is correct, balance the air outlets downstream from terminal units as described for constant-volume air systems.
   40. Adjust terminal units for minimum airflow.
   41. Measure static pressure at the sensor.
   42. Measure the return airflow to the fan while operating at maximum return airflow and minimum outside airflow. Adjust the fan and balance the return-air ducts and inlets as described for constant-volume air systems.
   43. Fundamental Procedures for Hydronic Systems:
