Seal all end terminations with pvc end caps and seal the end caps to the insulating jacketing and the bare pipe using only Dow “791” sealer, troweled or brushed to a minimum of 1/16 inch-thick coating, extending the coating 2 inches over the bare insulation, the bare pipe and under the adjacent jacketing.
   1. Where the operating temperature exceeds 180 degrees F, seal the end terminations with a brush coat of silicone sealant.
   1. Install pvc valve and flange covers in the same manner as the pipe jacketing, using extra long pvc covers to allow for bolt removal clearance.
   1. Ambient and Chilled and Cold Piping, Equipment and Ductwork
   1. Ensure that the insulation vapor barrier is properly sealed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and the surface of the vapor barrier is perfectly dry before applying the pvc jacket.
   1. Do not install jacketing system with an ambient temperature under 35 degrees F.
   1. Install the pvc jacketing with matching one-piece pvc fitting covers. Provide the jacketing cut and precurled with longitudinal self-sealing lap tape over the properly sealed vapor barrier jacket. Overlap the circumferential seams by 2 inches. Paint all seam lap edges with pvc adhesive. Temporarily secure jacket with tape or elastic bands until the adhesive has dried.
   1. Install pvc valve and flange covers in the same manner as the pipe jacketing, properly sealing around valve packing glands and stems, using extra long pvc covers to allow for bolt removal. Seal the insulation on all fittings, elbows, couplings, flanges, valve bodies, etc. with Dow “Saran 520” or mastic/ fabric/mastic application. 
   1. Outdoor Applications:
      1. all outdoor insulated piping, fittings, and equipment.
 2. Install metal jacket weatherproofing over the outer surfaces of all insulation work on all piping, ductwork and equipment located outdoors. Fabricate all metal jacketing of aluminum. 
   2. Install metal jacketing as soon as possible after the insulation work has been completed. At the end of the day apply the metal jacketing to all insulation materials applied on that day. Temporarily protect any exposed insulation with a combination moisture and/or UV barrier such as black polyethylene film, sealed to the pipe, duct or equipment.
   3. Do not apply mastics when the ambient temperature is, or is expected to be in the next 24 hours, below 340 degrees F unless specifically approved for that use by the manufacturer.
   4. Cut all openings in the metal jacketing for nozzles, brackets, protrusions, etc. as close as possible to achieve a tight fit. Use silicone or butyl based caulking compounds to seal all projections and penetrations.
   5. Piping 
   6. Provide a minimum of 2-inch overlap on all circumferential and longitudinal joints. Locate the longitudinal lap on horizontal piping alternatively at either the ten o’clock or two o’clock position to shed rainwater. Support metal jacketing on vertical piping by means ”S” clips made from stainless steel metal bands.
   7. Provide preformed RPR “Insul-Mate” metal elbows, Childers “ELL-Jac” or “Univers-Ells” for fittings on piping up to NPS 12 and metal gore elbows on piping above NPS 12. Provide smooth metal jacketing over flanges and flanged fittings. Use stainless steel bands for securing metal jacketing on preformed and gored elbow covers. Provide metal jacketing with raised bead for proper closing of gores. Wherever possible, avoid using screws, pop rivets, etc; however where they must be used to secure irregular shapes, drill all holes before the metal jacketing is put in place over the insulation. Tape a 3-inch wide by 0.020 inch aluminum strip over the insulation under the seam of the metal jacketing.
   8. Ductwork and Equipment
   9. Apply metal jacketing for horizontal and vertical ductwork and equipment surfaces with 3-inch joint laps.
   10. Fabricate metal jacketing for equipment vessel heads of a one-piece dish or conical sections fitted to the insulation. Install head covers to overlap the shell jackets by 4 inches and fasten by means of 1/2-inch x 0.020-inch stainless steel band, one for every gore. Install an additional band, 4 inches wide and secure with stainless steel bands.
   1. Secure metal jacketing on horizontal and vertical ductwork and equipment with 1/2-inch x 0.020-inch stainless steel bands spaced on 12-inch centers. Wherever possible, avoid using screws, pop rivets, etc.; however where they must be used to secure irregular shapes, drill all holes before the metal jacketing is placed over the insulation. Support metal jacketing on vertical equipment by means of “S” clips on 12-inch centers.
