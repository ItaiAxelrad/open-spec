## Execution

1. VALVE EXAMINATION 1. Examine valve interior for cleanliness, freedom from foreign matter, and corrosion. Remove special packing materials, such as blocks, used to prevent disc movement during shipping and handling. 2. Operate valves in positions from fully open to fully closed and examine guides and seats made accessible. 3. Examine threads on valve and mating pipe for form and cleanliness. 4. Examine mating flange faces for conditions that might cause leakage. Check bolting for proper size, length and material. Verify that gasket is of the proper size, that its material composition is suitable for the service, and that it is free from defects and damage. 5. Do not attempt to repair defective valves; replace with new valves.
1. JOINT CONSTRUCTION 1. See Division 23 sections of the Specifications for basic piping joint construction.
1. ADJUSTING 1. Adjust or replace valve packing after piping systems have been tested and put into service but before final adjusting and balancing. Replace valves if persistent leaking occurs.
1. Valve Installation\*
1. General
1. Provide isolation valves in piping services where branch lines connect to mains and risers.

1. Provide throttling valves where pressure regulation or modulating flow are required.
1. Provide throttling valves to serve as drain valves at low points and at piping dead ends.
1. Provide only ball valves on strainer blow down service.
1. Provide plugs or caps on all drain, vent or other open ended lines and valves.
1. Provide NPS ¾ drain valves on piping up through NPS 4 and NPS 1-1/2 drain valves on piping NPS 5 and larger.
1. Provide valves NPS 2-1/2 and larger with a drain valve on upper side of valve.
   1. Isolation Valves and Unions at Equipment
1. Provide isolation valves and unions at the individual connections to equipment, PRV stations and piping elements to permit complete servicing or removal of piping elements and items of equipment.
   1. By-Pass Valves
1. Where by-pass valves are shown to be installed around pressure regulating valves and automatic control valves, size the by-pass valve the same size as the pressure regulating or automatic control valve.
   1. Automatic Valves
1. Install automatic valves furnished as specified in Division 23 sections of the Specifications.
   1. Copper Tubing Adapters
1. When connecting copper tubing to valves, install adapters as follows:
1. Cast copper solder male adapter or union to screwed valves.
1. Copper solder joint companion flange unit.
1. Solder joint valve substitutions for valves specified are not permitted.
