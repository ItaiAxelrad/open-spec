      1. Construct and install each duct system for the specific dust pressure classification indicated.
   1. Install ducts with the fewest possible joints.
   1. Use fabricated fittings for all changes in directions, changes in size and shape, and connections.
   1. Install couplings tight to duct wall surface with projections into duct at connections kept to a minimum.
   1. Locate ducts, except as otherwise indicated, vertically and horizontally, parallel and perpendicular to building lines; avoid diagonal runs. Install duct systems in shortest route that does not obstruct useable space or block access for servicing building and its equipment.
1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Disassemble, reassemble, and seal segments of the systems as required to accommodate leakage testing and as required for compliance with test requirements.
   1. Conduct tests, in the presence of the Engineer, at static pressures equal to the maximum design pressure of the system or the section being tested. If pressure classifications are not indicated, test entire system at the maximum system design pressure. Do not pressurize systems above the maximum design operating pressure. Give seven days advance notice for testing.
   1. Maximum Allowable Leakage:
      1. As described in ASHRAE 1989 Handbook, "Fundamentals" Volume, Chapter 32, Table 6 and Figure 10. Comply with requirements for leakage classification 3 for round and flat oval ducts, leakage classification 12 for rectangular ducts in pressure classifications less than and equal to 2 inches water gauge (both positive and negative pressures), and leakage classification 6 for pressure classifications greater than 2 inches water gauge and less than and equal to 10 inches water gauge.
   1. Owner Technical Representative has the authority to require further duct sealing by the contractor if he determines there is excessive leakage. This determination may be based on noise, drafts, poor system performance, or other factors.
   1. Remake leaking joints as required and apply sealants to achieve specified maximum allowable leakage.
   1. Leakage Test:
      1. Perform volumetric measurements and adjust air systems as described in ASHRAE 1987 "HVAC Systems and Applications" Volume, Chapter 57; ASHRAE 1989 "Fundamentals" Volume, Chapter 13; and Division 23 sections of the Specifications.
1. ADJUSTING
   1. Adjust volume control devices as required by the testing and balancing procedures to achieve required airflow. See Division 22 sections of the Specifications for requirements and procedures for adjusting and balancing air systems.
1. CLEANING
   1. Vacuum duct systems prior to final acceptance to remove dust and debris.
