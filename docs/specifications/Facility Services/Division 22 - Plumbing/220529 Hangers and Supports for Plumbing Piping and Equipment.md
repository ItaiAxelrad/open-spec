Install additional attachments at concentrated loads, including valves, flanges, guides, strainers, expansion joints, and at changes in direction of piping. Install concrete inserts before concrete is placed; fasten insert to forms.

   1. Installation of Anchors - Attaching supports to bar joists:
      1. Pipe hangers for pipe 2 1/2" and over in diameter. Where pipe hangers and supports are to be attached to bar joists, the attachment is to be made from the top chord of the bar joists. Attachments to the bottom chord are unacceptable.
      1. Install anchors at proper locations to prevent stresses from exceeding those permitted by ASME B31.9 and to prevent transfer of loading and stresses to connected equipment.
      1. Fabricate and install anchor by welding steel shapes, plates, and bars to piping and to structure. Comply with ASME B31.9 and with AWS D1.1.
