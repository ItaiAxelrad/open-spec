   1. Fill voids between the pipe and the trench floor or walls with 10-MPa (1500-psi) concrete. Mark risers which are not extended to the property line by placing a 25 x 50-mm (1 x 2-inch) x 1.8-meter (6-foot) length of cypress, ash, or cedar (or any other approved markers) from a point directly above the end of pipe and 300 mm (one foot) below the surface and extending vertically downward.
   1. Building Connections
   1. Construct building connections at the location shown, in the same manner as the main sewer pipe; specifications and requirements for the main sewer shall apply. Place a watertight stopper or plug in the end of building connections. Remove stoppers or plugs at the time final connections are made to the building sewers.
    1. Field Quality Control

General
   1. The Owner will employ an independent testing agency to monitor Contractor's testing of sewer systems and to approve backfill and compaction methods as specified in Section 01450.
   1. Complete finish Work on structures and sewer line prior to any testing of the line.
   1. Prior to testing for leakage, backfill the trench sufficiently to prevent pipe movement during testing, leaving joints uncovered to permit inspection.
   1. Secure plugs or caps on branch connection against blow-off during leakage testing.
   1. Field Control Tests
   1. Test storm sewer systems.
   1. Perform tests in accordance with applicable local codes or as specified, whichever is more stringent.
   1. Perform an infiltration test if ground water is present during the installation of the system. If no ground water is present during the installation, conduct an exfiltration or low pressure air test on the system.
   1. Install and test double-wall oil/water separator tank in accordance with the manufacturer's current underground storage tank (UST) installation instructions.
   1. Submit test results and calculations to the Architect.
   1. Infiltration or Exfiltration Test
   1. Refer to the UNI Handbook for recommendations for pvc pipe.
   1. Maximum infiltration/exfiltration of each individual section (manhole to manhole):
      1. For PVC Pipe:
         1. 4.7 liters/mm dia./km (50 gal./inch dia./mile) of pipe/24 hours.
   1. Include building connections in computations for maximum infiltration/exfiltration limits.
   1. In the event of excess infiltration/exfiltration, take the necessary measures to correct the situations by a method approved by the Architect.
   1. Low Pressure Air Test
   1. Test method and minimum test time required for pressure to drop from 24 to 17 kPa (3.5 to 2.5 psi):
      1. For PVC pipe:
         1. UNI-B-6.
   1. The holding times may be waived if the sewer appears tight.
   1. Deflection Testing
   1. Perform random deflection tests on installed pipe. Use electronic deflectometers, calibrated television or video camera, or properly sized "go, no go" mandrel or sewer ball for deflection testing.
   1. Maximum deflection of installed plastic pipes (ABS, PSM and pvc) measured not less than 30 days following completion of installation:
      1. 7-1/2 percent of base inside diameter.
   1. Test Results
   1. Correct visible leaks regardless of test results.
   1. Should the sewer systems fail to meet the test requirements, make the necessary repairs to the systems and re-test. Submit all test results and calculations to the Architect for final approval.
   1. Cleaning
   1. Prior to final acceptance of the Contract, make necessary corrections and adjustments and finish cleanup operations. Clean sewer pipes, manholes, and other related drainage structures and flush them out with water, after paving and lawn work has been completed and accepted. Leave drainage systems clean, clear of debris and other materials.
