         1. Section 28 10 00
   1. Building Intrusion Alarm System

General

* 
	1. Summary
   1. This section includes:
	1. The basic requirements and intent for a design-build building intrusion alarm system.
	2. General Requirements
2. The contractor shall provide for the design and installation of a building intrusion alarm system to serve as a precaution against trespassing, vandalism, and sabotage of the water treatment facility.
3. The design shall allow for the future capability for monitoring the system utilizing a 3rd party remote monitoring service.
4. All equipment associated with the intrusion alarm system shall be rated for continuous operation.
	1. Environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity, wind, chemical exposure, and seismic activity) shall be taken under consideration at each facility and site location prior to installation of the equipment.
	2. All equipment shall have a back-up source of power that will provide a minimum of 96 hours of run time in the event of a loss of primary power to the facility.
5. All equipment shall operate on a 120 or 240 volts alternating current (VAC); 60 Hz AC power system unless required otherwise.
6. Surge Protection:
	1. Protect components from voltage surges originating external to equipment housing and entering through power, communication, signal, control, or sensing leads. Include surge protection for external wiring of each conductor entry connection to components.
7. All doors and windows that are able to be opened (including overhead doors) shall have contact sensors.
8. Lower level windows shall be monitored using glass break sensors.
9. The Contractor shall install motion detectors to provide for full coverage of the building. A minimum of three (3) motion detectors are anticipated.
	1. Functional Description of System
10. Supervision:
	1. System components shall be continuously monitored for normal, alarm, supervisory, and trouble conditions via a local alarm control panel.
		1. Indicate deviations from normal conditions at any location in system.
			1. Indication includes identification of device or circuit in which deviation has occurred and whether deviation is an alarm or malfunction.
	2. System shall have the capability of connecting to a 3rd party monitoring subscription based company however initially will not include this monitoring.
11. Alarm Signal:
	1. Display at central-station control unit and actuate audible and visual alarm devices.
12. Trouble Condition Signal:
	1. Distinct from other signals, indicating that system is not fully functional. Trouble signal shall indicate system problems such as battery failure, open or shorted transmission line conductors, or controller failure.
13. Supervisory Condition Signal:
	1. Distinct from other signals, indicating an abnormal condition as specified for the particular device or controller.
14. System Control:
	1. Central-station control unit shall directly monitor intrusion detection units and connecting wiring.
	2. System shall automatically reboot program without error, loss of status, or loss of alarm data after any system disturbance.
	3.  Manual Secure-Access Control:
		1. Coded entries at manual stations shall change status of associated protected zone between secure and access conditions.
15. Control Panel:
	1. The control panel shall be the main point of programming, monitoring, accessing, securing, and troubleshooting the intrusion alarm system.
		1. Refer to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) CP-01 Control Panel Standard-Features for False Alarm Reduction.
	2. The control panel shall provide a means of reporting alarms to an Physical Access Control System and Database Management via a computer interface or direct connection to an alarm control monitoring panel.
	3. The control panel shall provide a general alarm and/or alarm status output that can be received by MCP-100 and transmitted via the existing telemetry to the Fish Creek Water Treatment Facility.
	4. The control panel shall utilize a Multifunctional Keypad, Input and Output Modules for expansion of alarm zones, interfacing with additional security subsystems, programming, monitoring and controlling the intrusion alarm system.
	5. Quality Assurance
16. The security system shall be installed and tested to ensure all components are fully compatible as a system and can be integrated with all associated security subsystems, whether the security system is stand-alone or a part of a complete Information Technology (IT) computer network.
17. The Contractor or security sub-contractor shall be a licensed security Contractor as required within the state or jurisdiction of where the installation work is being conducted.
18. A manufacturer’s representative must be capable of providing on-site installation, testing, and training services.
	1. Warranty
19. See Division 0 for project warranty requirements.
	1. Submittals
20. Shop Drawings:
	1. See Specification Section 01 33 00 for requirements for the mechanics and administration of the submittal process.
21. Product data:
	1. Provide product data sheets for all system components.
	2. Provide a schedule for all of the applicable security systems and subsystems that shall be included.
		1. Device ID.
		2. Device Location.
		3. Mounting type (e.g. flush, wall, surface, etc.).
		4. Power supply or circuit breaker and power panel number.
22. Operation and Maintenance Manuals:
	1. See Specification Section 01 78 23 for requirements for:
		1. The mechanics and administration of the submittal process.
		2. The content of Operation and Maintenance Manuals.
	2. Provide at least two (2) sets of manufacturer’s hardware installation and software user guides for each level of authorized users.
23. Test Plan:
	1. Submit for approval at least 30 days prior to commencement of formal testing, a Security System Operational Test Plan. Include procedures for operational testing of each component and security subsystem, to include performance of an integrated system test.
   ## Product (Not Used)

Execution

* 
	1. Installation
   1. Install the system in accordance with the equipment manufacturers recommended procedures.
2. Install system using generally acceptable industry practices for network appliances.
3. Ensure system and network configuration is fully coordinated with the Owner’s network and systems configuration.
	1. Testing and Training
4. Coordinate the startup and contractor testing schedules with the Owner and Engineer. Provide a minimum of 7 days prior notice.
5. Test system as recommended by manufacturer, including the following:
	1. Conduct complete inspection and testing of equipment, including verification of operation with connected equipment.
	2. Test devices and demonstrate operational features for Owner's representative and authorities having jurisdiction as applicable.
	3. Correct deficiencies until satisfactory results are obtained.
	4. Submit written copies of test results.
