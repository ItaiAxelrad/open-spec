1. ERECTION INSTALLATION APPLICATION

General
:
      1. Comply with the manufacturer's written installation and alignment instructions.
   1. Install pumps in locations indicated and arranged to provide access for periodic maintenance, including removal of motors, impellers, couplings, and accessories.
   1. Support pumps and piping separately so that the weight of the piping system does not rest on the pump.
   1. Suspend inline pumps using all-thread hanger rod and vibration isolation hangers of sufficient size to support the weight of the pump, independent from the piping system.
   1. Set base-mounted pumps on a concrete foundation. Disconnect coupling halves before setting. Do not reconnect couplings until the alignment operations have been completed.
   1. Support pump base plate on rectangular metal blocks and shims, or on metal wedges having a small taper, at points near the foundation bolts to provide a gap of 3/4 to 1-1/2 inches between the pump base and the foundation for grouting. Grout pump bases with non-shrink grout.
   1. Adjust the metal supports or wedges until the shafts of the pump and driver are level. Check the coupling faces and suction and discharge flanges of the pump to verify that they are level and plumb.
   1. Alignment:
      1. Align pump and motor shafts and piping connections after setting on foundations, after grout has been set and foundations bolts have been tightened, and after piping connections have been made.
   1. Adjust alignment of pump and motor shafts for angular and parallel alignment by method detailed in NREL Alignment Specification.
   1. After alignment is correct, tighten the foundation bolts evenly but not too firmly. Fill the base plate completely with nonshrink, nonmetallic grout, with metal blocks and shims or wedges in place. After grout has cured, fully tighten foundation bolts.
   1. Alignment tolerances shall meet manufacturer's recommendations.
   1. Connections:

General
:
         1. Install valves that are same size as the piping connecting the pump.
   1. Install suction and discharge pipe sizes equal to or greater than the diameter of the pump nozzles.
   1. Install a nonslam check valve matching the pipe size on the discharge side of the pump. Install a butterfly (over 2 inch pipe size) or ball (2 inch and under) isolation valve on the discharge side of inline pumps. Isolation valves are to be installed downstream of the check valve.
   1. Install a butterfly (over 2 inch pipe size) or ball valve (2 inch and under) on the suction side of inline pumps.
   1. Install a pump suction diffuser and butterfly valve on the suction side of base-mounted, end-suction pumps.
   1. Install flexible connectors on the suction and discharge side of each base-mounted pump. Install flexible connectors between the pump casing and the discharge valves and upstream from the pump suction diffuser.
   1. Install temperature and pressure gauge connector plugs in suction and discharge piping around pump. Temperature and pressure gauge connector plugs are specified in Division 23 sections of the Specifications. Where shown on drawings, install differential pressure gauge tree across pump suction and discharge.
   1. Electrical wiring and connections are specified in Division 16 sections of the Specifications.
   1. Control wiring and connections are specified in other Division 15 sections of the Specifications.
   1. Commissioning:
    1. Final Checks Before Start-Up:
       1. Perform the following preventative maintenance operations and checks before start-up:
          1. Lubricate oil-lubricated bearings.
   1. Remove grease-lubricated bearing covers and flush the bearings with kerosene and thoroughly clean. Fill with new lubricant in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
   1. Disconnect coupling and check motor for proper rotation. Rotation shall match direction of rotation marked on pump casing.
   1. Check that pump is free to rotate by hand. For pumps handling hot liquids, pump shall be free to rotate with the pump hot and cold. If the pump is bound or even drags slightly, do not operate the pump until the cause of the trouble is determined and corrected.
   1. Starting procedure for pumps with shutoff power not exceeding the safe motor power:
      1. Prime the pump, open the suction valve, closing the drains, and prepare the pump for operation.
   1. Open the sealing liquid supply valve if the pump is so fitted.
   1. Start the motor.
   1. Slowly open the discharge valve.
   1. Observe for leakage from the mechanical seal. Stop pump immediately if mechanical seal leaks.
   1. Check the general mechanical operation of the pump and motor.
   1. If the pump is to be started against a closed check valve with the discharge gate valve open, the steps are the same, except that the discharge isolation valve is opened some time before the motor is started.
   1. Refer to related Division 23 sections of the Specifications for detailed requirements for testing, adjusting, and balancing hydronic systems.
1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Check suction line connections for tightness to avoid drawing air into the pump.
   1. Check all connections for tightness to avoid water leakage.
   1. Subcontractor is responsible for cleaning up and repairing damage due to leaking joints.
