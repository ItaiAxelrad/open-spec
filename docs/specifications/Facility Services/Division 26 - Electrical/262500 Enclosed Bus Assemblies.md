   1. Provide neutral bus rated 100 percent of phase bus. 
   1. Provide 50 percent capacity internal ground bus. 
   1. Provide common phase rotation throughout the system. 
   1. Provide bus system design which limits maximum busway hot spot to 55 degrees C. based on 40 degrees C. ambient temperature per UL 857. 
   1. Plug-in Units 
   1. Provide totally-enclosed, quick-make, quick-break fusible switch type plug-in units with class R fuse clips and which comply with applicable requirements of NEMA KS 1 and UL 98.

General

   1. Install busways in accordance with ANSI NECA 408.
   1. Provide final field measurements for busway routing prior to fabrication of busway. 
   1. Install integral fire stops where busway penetrates fire-rated walls and floors. Seal around opening to maintain fire-rating equal to or greater than wall or floor rating. Coordinate with related Division 7 sections of the Specifications. 
   1. Install busway parallel or perpendicular to the building construction lines unless otherwise indicated.
