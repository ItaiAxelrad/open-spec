1. This Section uses the term "Architect." Change this term to match that used to identify the design professional as defined in the General and Supplementary Conditions.
1. Verify that Section titles referenced in this Section are correct for this Project's Specifications; Section titles may have changed.
1. If applying for LEED certification, LEED-NC Prerequisite EA 2 requires compliance with ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-2004, which requires the use of mechanical or electrical variable speed drives on fan motors used in VAV system fans that are 15 hp and larger and on motors in variable flow hydronic systems that are larger than 50 hp.
1. Energy savings resulting from the use of variable frequency motor controllers on motors other than required by Prerequisite EA 2 can be combined with other energy-saving measures to meet the requirements of LEED-NC Credit EA 1.
1. LEED-NC Credit EA 5 requires the development of a Measurement & Verification (M&V) Plan to achieve this credit. Energy used by each VFC can be used in the simulation calibration process required by the International Performance Measurement & Verification Protocol (IPMVP), Volume III, Chapter 4, "Whole Building Calibrated Simulation" (Option D) to verify the building's compliance with this credit.
