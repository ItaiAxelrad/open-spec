   1. Warranty.
   1. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM 
   1. The installer shall provide a complete installation of equipment to comprise a complete system against damage by lightning. The installer shall be responsible for all material and labor to accomplish this result. 
   1. The system shall be installed so that completed work is unobtrusive and does not detract from the building appearance.
   1. CODES, REGULATIONS, PERMITS 
   1. The completed system shall comply with the manufacturer’s standard, equipment supplier drawings and specification requirements for installation of lightning protection systems. The installer, at his expense, shall accomplish any corrections required by the inspection. Noncompliance shall be reported to the equipment supplier for consideration.
   1. Comply with recommendations in NFPA 780, Annex D, "Inspection and Maintenance of Lightning Protection Systems," for maintenance of the lightning protection system.
   1. STANDARDS OF QUALITY 
   1. Installer Qualifications:
      1. Certified by UL or LPI as a Master Installer/Designer, trained and approved for installation of units required for this Project
   1. The system equipment supplier, contractor, and installer shall install the system in compliance with the Manufacturer’s Standard. 
   1. Electrical Components, Devices, and Accessories:
      1. Listed and labeled as defined in NFPA 780, "Definitions" Article.
   1. SERVICE AND TESTING 
   1. Installation of equipment shall be done under the direct supervision of a manufacturer representative and per the manufacturer’s requirements.
   1. The installer shall provide photos and/or video of the installation, including but not limited to, mast mounting, bonding connections (waterline & structural steel), down conductors, ground rods/grids and especially all buried, concealed or inaccessible connections and components. This information shall be forwarded to the manufacturer for evaluation, certification, archiving and documentation.
   1. The ground resistance of the completed system shall be measured using IEEE "Fall of Potential Method" in the presence of the Contracting Officer and shall be forwarded to the manufacturer. Ground resistance shall be ten (10) Ohms or less. 
   1. COORDINATION
   1. Coordinate installation of lightning protection with installation of other building systems and components, including electrical wiring, supporting structures and building materials, metal bodies requiring bonding to lightning protection components, and building finishes.
   1. Coordinate installation of air terminals attached to roof systems with roofing manufacturer and Installer.
   1. Flashings of through-roof assemblies shall comply with roofing manufacturers' specifications.

## General

   1. CONDUCTORS

 .
