   1. Temporary Erosion Controls

General

* 
	1. **Summary

	1. **Work Included
2. This item of work shall consist of preparing an erosion and sediment control plan. The erosion and sediment control plan shall be prepared by the Contractor and submitted to the Project Engineer for review prior to initiating construction activities. 
	1. As required contractor shall also obtain any required State of Colorado permits and submit a copy of the approved permit to the Project Engineer prior to start of construction.
3. The elements required to implement the erosion and sediment control plan shall be in general conformance with:
	1. Details included in the Urban Drainage and Flood Control "Erosion Control Manual",
	2. The City of Steamboat Springs Construction Site Management Plan requirements, and
	3. The State of Colorado Storm Water Management Permit for Construction Sites requirements.
4. The Contractor shall furnish, install, clean, and maintain all erosion control measures during construction and vegetation establishment, and remove and dispose of all temporary erosion control measures upon completion of revegetation and prior to contract close out unless otherwise approved by the Project Engineer.
5. The Contractor shall clean off any soil, dirt, or debris tracked onto any adjacent streets. The Contractor shall maintain clean conditions on adjacent street before, during, and after working hours.
6. Preparation of a dewatering / discharge plan for the Work.
	1. If required for the work, Contractor shall prepare a Dewatering plan for review and approval of the Project Engineer prior to undertaking the Work requiring dewatering / discharge permits.
	2. Contractor shall also obtain and implement any required State of Colorado dewatering permit including approval by the City Engineer, providing a copy of that permit to the Project Engineer prior to initiating dewatering activities.
7. The Contractor shall assign to the project an employee to serve in the capacity of the Erosion Control Supervisor (ECS). The ECS shall be experienced in all aspects of construction and have satisfactorily completed an ECS training program authorized by the State of Colorado. Proof that this requirement has been met shall be submitted to the Project Engineer at least ten working days prior to the beginning of any construction work.
8. The Contractor shall be responsible for installing and maintaining all erosion and sedimentation control measures in accordance with all City, County, State, and Federal guidelines and regulations.
	1. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining appropriate documentation in accordance with all regulations.
9. Copies of any state permits and the approved Erosion and Sediment Control plan shall be kept onsite at all times.
	1. **Submittals
10. Prior to the start of any related construction:
	1. Submit a copy of the site Erosion and Sediment Control Plan to the City of Steamboat Springs Construction Services Foreman for review and approval prior to start of construction
	2. Submit a copy of any required State of Colorado construction related permits (for example dewatering permits or Storm water management permit for construction sites) to the City of Steamboat Springs Construction Services Foreman prior to the start of construction.
   1. Product
1. 2.1 General
   1. Erosion control materials used shall conform to the requirements of Section 209 of the Colorado Department of Transportation Standards and Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, 2005.
   1. Execution
1. 3.1 General
   1. The erosion and sediment control features shall be installed prior to clearing and grubbing and shall remain in place throughout construction.
2. It is the Contractor’s responsibility to protect his work with adequate water control measures.
3. Provide mud traps, rugs, or other features to prevent the tracking of dirt and mud into businesses and residences or on adjacent streets.
4. Any fines incurred for failure to properly install or maintain adequate erosion control or offsite damage due to failure of erosion control shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor.
5. Contractor shall maintain on site at all times a copy of the current erosion control plan and storm water management plan.
6. The erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan shall at a minimum include:
	1. Topographic Information – including sufficient detail to characterize the site
	2. Areas and extent of soil disturbance (show any phasing)
	3. Location of all on site and adjacent water bodies, wetlands, drainages, and storm water systems
	4. Location and type of proposed site controls including such items as diversion structures, check dams, silt fencing, straw wattles, sediment ponds, inlet protection, phasing to minimize disturbances, or other
	5. Vehicle soil tracking measures (vehicle track pad, vehicle wash station, etc.)
	6. Concrete washout areas and management methods.
	7. Identification of site personnel responsible for inspecting erosion control measures.
1. 3.2 Maintenance
   1. The Contractor shall remove sediment from upstream of sediment traps on an as needed basis prior to the sediment overcoming the device. Sediment removed shall be legally disposed of by the Contractor at no additional cost to Owner.
2. The Contractor shall inspect all erosion control features on a weekly basis and after every storm event and shall provide maintenance and/or cleanup including removal of mud tracking on streets as necessary at no additional cost to owner.
