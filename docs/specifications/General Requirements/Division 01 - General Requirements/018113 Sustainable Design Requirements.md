General
   1. ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT
   1. The Owner has established the following environmental requirements for the Project. These requirements are general in nature; refer to specific specification sections for more detailed requirements. Notify Owner and Architect if conflicts arise between performance of the work and environmental requirements. This specification is not intended to limit alternative means of achieving these requirements. Suggestions and input from the contractor(s) for implementing these requirements are encouraged. A team approach is encouraged. Refer to Section 015050 â€“ Construction Waste Management.
   1. Use resources efficiently:
      1. Reuse existing buildings and materials.
   1. Select materials that use resources efficiently.
   1. Use construction practices that achieve the most efficient use of resources and materials.
   1. Recycle or reuse job-site waste.
   1. Select recycled-content materials.
   1. Select materials that can be recycled.
   1. Avoid scarce, irreplaceable, or endangered resources:
      1. Select materials from abundant, well-managed resources.
   1. Select materials that are replaceable, renewable, or can be replenished.
      1. Select materials that minimize damage to natural habitats.
Use durable materials:
      1. Select materials with the longest usable life.
   1. Select materials that can be reused.
      1. Select materials with the least burdensome maintenance requirements.
Create spaces that are healthy for occupants:
      1. Select low-toxic products and materials.
   1. Select materials without toxic maintenance requirements.
   1. Specify mechanical equipment that will provide fresh air and will not trap water or pollutants.
   1. Use energy efficiently:
      1. Select materials with low embodied energy.
   1. Select materials that save energy during building operations.
   1. Select products and equipment that save energy during building operations.
   1. Use water efficiently:
      1. Use construction practices that achieve the most efficient use of water.
   1. Select water-conserving appliances and equipment.
   1. Landscape for water conservation.
   1. Detain and utilize rainwater.
   1. Select materials that generate the least amount of pollution. Consider pollution and toxins generated during harvesting, mining, manufacturing, transport, installation, use and disposal.
   1. Protect/restore natural habitats.
   1. ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTATION
   1. Contractor shall designate an on-site party (or parties) responsible for instructing workers and overseeing the Environmental Requirements for the Project.
   1. Distribution:
      1. The Contractor shall distribute copies of the Environmental Requirements to the Job-Site Foreman, each Subcontractor, the Owner, and the Architect.
   1. Meetings:
      1. Environmental Requirements shall be discussed at the following meetings:
      1. Pre-bid meeting
   1. Pre-construction meeting
   1. Regular job-site meetings
3. CONTRACTOR OBLIGATIONS
   1. Contractor to validate required recycled content and local/regional availability within 500 mile radius of project.
   1. Utilize attached recycle content worksheet to identify materials noted above. See 018113A, Appendix A Materials Anticipated to be Used for Recycle Content.
   1. Refer to attached LEED rating system matrix for project requirements. See 018113B, Appendix B LEED Matrix.
1. END OF SECTION
   1. The utilization of building materials with recycled content will be maximized in the construction of this project. The requirements established by Executive Order 13101, with regard to building construction materials will be met or exceeded. A listing of the materials anticipated to be of recycled content is provided below. The materials listed below, not indicating recycled content require the contractor to provide and list as much recycled content as feasible and the contractor may list additional materials to be considered/utilized with the recycled content and local/regional availability in the chart below to validate required recycled content and local/regional availability within 500 miles of project site.
