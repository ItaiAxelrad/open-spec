Prepare a separate listing and schedule, organized by related specification section number sequence, showing the principal work-related submittals and their initial submittal dates as required for coordination of the work. For Type 3 and Type 4 submittals, submit listing and schedule within five days after notice to proceed with construction or commencement of work.
   1. Submit with Contractor’s construction schedule, a complete schedule of submittals.
   1. Coordinate submittal schedule with the list of subcontracts, schedule of values and the list of products as well as the Contractor’s construction schedule.
   1. Prepare the schedule in chronological order. Provide the following information:

   1. Name of subcontractor
   1. Description of the part of the work covered

   1. Schedule Updating
   1. Revise the schedule after each meeting or activity, where revisions have been recognized or made.
   1. Issue the updated schedule concurrently with report of each meeting.
   1. Coordination
   1. Coordinate the preparation and processing of submittals with the performance of construction activities. Transmit each submittal sufficiently in advance of performance of related construction activities to avoid delay.
   1. Coordinate each submittal with fabrication, purchasing, testing, delivery, other submittals and related activities that require sequential activity.
   1. Coordinate transmittal of different types of submittals for related elements of the Work so processing will not be delayed by the need to review submittals concurrently for coordination.
   1. The Owner reserves the right to withhold action on a submittal requiring coordination with other submittals until all related submittals are received.
   1. Processing:
      1. To avoid the need to delay installation as a result of the time required to process submittals, allow sufficient time for submittal review, including time for resubmittals.
   1. Partial submission or return of submittals are not acceptable.
   1. Allow 10 working days for initial review. Allow additional time if processing must be delayed to permit coordination with subsequent submittals.
   1. Normally one resubmission is allowed and should take place within 10 working days of the returned documents and the follow on review should take less than five working days. With the exception of the single copy held by the Owner, all five copies are returned to the Contractor or vendor for correction. They are only distributed when all submittal items have been approved. Multiple submissions are not acceptable.
   1. If an intermediate submittal is necessary, process the same as the initial submittal.
   1. No extension of Contract Time will be authorized because of failure to transmit submittals to the Owner sufficiently in advance of the Work to permit processing.
   1. Submittal Preparation:
      1. Place a permanent label or title block on each submittal for identification. Indicate the name of the entity that prepared each submittal on the label or title block.
   1. Provide a space approximately 4 by 5 inches (100 by 125 mm) on the label or beside the title block on Shop Drawings to record the Contractor's review and approval markings and the action taken.
   1. Include the following information on the label for processing and recording action taken.
   1. Project name.
   1. Date.
   1. Name and address of the Owner.

   1. Name of the manufacturer.
   1. Number and title of appropriate Specification Section.
   1. Drawing number and detail references, as appropriate.
   1. Submittal Transmittal:
      1. Package each submittal appropriately for transmittal and handling. Transmit each submittal from the Contractor to the Owner using a transmittal form. Submittals received from sources other than the Contractor will be returned without action.
   1. On the transmittal, record relevant information and requests for data. On the form, or separate sheet, record deviations from Contract Document requirements, including variations and limitations. Include Contractor's certification that information complies with Contract Document requirements.
