General

* 
	1. **Summary
   1. Work included:
      1. 
	1. Throughout the Contract Documents, reference is made to codes and standards which establish qualities and types of workmanship and materials, and which establish methods for testing and reporting on pertinent characteristics.
	2. Where materials or workmanship are required by these Contract Documents to meet or exceed the specifically named code or standard, it is the Contractor’s responsibility to provide materials and workmanship which meet or exceed the specifically named code or standard.
	3. It is also the Contractor’s responsibility, when so required by the Contract Documents or by written request from the Engineer, to deliver to the Engineer all required proof that the materials or workmanship, or both, meet or exceed the requirements of the specifically named code or standard. Such proof shall be in the form requested in writing by the Engineer, and generally will be required to be copies of a certified report of tests conducted by a testing agency approved for that purpose by the Engineer.

	4. Specific naming of codes or standards occurs on the drawings and in other sections of these Specifications.
	5. **Quality Assurance
3. Familiarity with pertinent codes and standards:
      1. 
	1. In procuring all items used in this work, it is the Contractor’s responsibility to verify the detailed requirements of the specifically named codes and standards and to verify that the items procured for use in this work meet or exceed the specified requirements.
4. Rejection of non-complying items:
	1. The Engineer reserves the right to reject items incorporated into the work which fail to meet the specified minimum requirements. The Engineer further reserves the right, and without prejudice to other recourse the Engineer may take, to accept non-specified items subject to review and approval by Owner. Under Owner Contracts, an adjustment in the Contract Amount may be applicable.
	2. Reference Standards
5. The Contractor is responsible for being familiar with all named or implied codes. The latest revision or edition of codes or standards shall be used.
6. Work specified by reference to a published standard or specification of a government agency, technical association, trade association, professional society or institute, testing agency, or other organization must meet or exceed the minimum quality standards for the material and workmanship in the designated standard or specification.
7. Where specified, assure products or workmanship meets the prescriptive or performance requirements in the Contract Documents when it is a more stringent standard than the referenced standard. Contract should reference only one specification to prevent argument as to which specification is most stringent.
8. Where the specific issue date of the standard is not identified in the standard, the edition and all published amendments available on the date of the Invitation to Bid apply.
9. If two or more standards are specified, provide the product and workmanship meeting or exceeding the requirements of the most stringent standard.
10. If a conflict exists between standards, meet the more stringent standard.
11. Where both a standard and a brand name are specified, assure the proprietary product names meet or exceed the specified reference standard. The listing of a trade name in a Contract Document does not warrant that the product meets the referenced standard.
12. Copies of Standards:
	1. Copies of applicable referenced standards are not bound in this Contract Document.
	2. Where the contractor needs copies of standards for work superintendence and quality control, obtain a copy or copies directly from the publication sources and maintain copies at the job site, making them available to Contractor personnel, subcontractors, OWNER, and ENGINEER.
