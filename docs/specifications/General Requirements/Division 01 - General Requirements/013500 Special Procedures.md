   1. Section 01 35 00
1. Spec**i**al Conditions

General

* 
	1. **Summary
   1. Section includes:
	1. Cold Weather Specifications - Addendum #1 to Mount Werner Water Specifications for Cold Weather Water and Sewer Pipeline Construction (November 2006, updated March 19, 2008)
	2. **General Requirements
2. Cold Weather Precautions and Specifications shall take effect when any of the following temperature conditions occur, or between November 1 and May 1, whichever occurs first:
	1. When the 10:00 AM temperature is below 30-degrees Fahrenheit for 3 consecutive days, pipe installation shall not be permitted without an approved Mitigation Plan.
	2. No pipe installation shall be allowed, regardless of mitigation efforts, when the temperature drops below 20-degrees Fahrenheit or when conditions are outside the manufacturer’s installation specifications or recommendations, whichever is more restrictive.
	3. Pipe installation operations may resume after 3 consecutive days when the 10:00 AM temperature is above 30-degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Mitigation:
	1. Any requests to install water and sewer pipelines under these Cold Weather Specifications shall be subject to mitigation efforts and shall be made in writing to The Mount Werner Water and Sanitation District. The following are some guidelines for mitigation:
		1. Experience has indicated that worker morale and quality of pipeline installation is related to jobsite conditions. Temporary heated facilities shall be provided to mitigate cold and wet weather working conditions.
		2. PVC pipe and fittings shall be protected from the elements and installed in accordance with the Uni-Bell Plastic Pipe Association “Handbook of PVC Pipe Design and Construction”. For quality control purposes, temporary enclosed facilities will be necessary to store all PVC pipe and pipe parts to ensure protection of materials from the elements in order to meet manufacturer’s installation specifications.
		3. All PVC pipe shall be un-banded and stored in a heated environment at a minimum temperature of 50-degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum of 24 hours prior to installation to allow all pipe materials to return to original manufactured memory.
		4. All ductile iron pipe gaskets shall be stored in a heated environment not less than 50-degrees Fahrenheit. Gaskets shall be installed after the pipe has been set in place and just prior to homing the next pipe.
		5. The Contractor’s Cold Weather Mitigation Plan will require full time engineering observation by a professional engineer registered in the State of Colorado or a properly trained engineering technician with adequate experience under the direct supervision of a professional engineer. All pipe components and bedding shall be inspected prior to backfill.
		6. Allowance for Thermal Expansion and Contraction: Per the Uni-Bell Plastic Pipe Association “Handbook of PVC Pipe Design and Construction” states, “As a general rule for every temperature change of 10-degrees Fahrenheit, PVC pipe will expand or contract 1/3” (0.023’) per 100-ft. The Contractor’s Mitigation Plan shall reflect a pipe stabbing plan that incorporates this variable for pipe installation and stabbing operations.
		7. All excavated backfill materials shall be protected from the elements to ensure adequate materials and placement specifications are met. Frozen backfill and bedding materials are non-conforming and shall not be used.
		8. Trench excavation shall be limited to only the amount of material that can be backfilled within any one day with a maximum of 60-feet of open trench at any given time. Prior to leaving the site for the day, all pipe trenches shall be fully backfilled to existing grades and compacted to specifications. No open trenches shall be allowed overnight. Backfill operations shall be coordinated with the soils engineer, in order for proper inspections to be made.
		9.  An additional 2 years of Warranty shall be provided over and above the standard one-year warranty period specified in other sections. Bonding shall be implemented through the City of Steamboat Springs Planning process to secure installation quality in the amount of 15% of the construction costs for the entire warranty period. 
		10. Prior to Preliminary Acceptance and in addition to all other warranties the Contractor installing the facilities shall provide to the District a written 3-year, materials, labor and equipment warranty on his letterhead. The warranty period shall commence upon the dated letter of Preliminary Acceptance by Mount Werner Water.
		11. Trench dewatering operations shall be controlled and set up to prevent problems to downstream storm water facilities or any hazard to the motoring public or to any other properties. Under no circumstances shall groundwater be allowed to enter the pipe.
		12. Standard bedding and shading specifications shall be increased from 4” below the pipe and 6” above the pipe, to 8” below the pipe and 12” above the pipe.
		13.  On-site air temperature readings shall be obtained and documented by the Engineer. This information shall be recorded in the engineers daily reporting system.
