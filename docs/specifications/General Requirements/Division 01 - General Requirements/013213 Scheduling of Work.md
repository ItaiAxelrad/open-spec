   1. Section 01 32 00
   1. Construction Progress Schedule

General

* 
	1. **Summary
   1. Section Includes:
	1. Specific requirements for the preparation, submittal, updating, and status reporting of the construction Progress Schedule.
2. Review of the CPM Schedule:
	1. In so far as the Contractor is solely responsible for its means and methods and the CPM schedule represents in part its means and methods, the review of the CPM schedules (preliminary, baseline, updates, revisions, etc.) is for compliance with the requirements as defined in the contract documents.
	2. The review of the CPM schedule is not intended to be complete or exhaustive or check every activity and its relation to the work.
	3. The Engineer will provide comments on the CPM schedule compliance with those contract requirements and anomalies that might appear to the Engineer.
	4. If the Contractor fails to include contract requirements (e.g. specified cure times, commissioning periods) in the CPM schedule, or the Engineer fails to notify the Contractor of anomalies the Contractor is not relieved of the contract requirements.
	5. Acceptance of the CPM schedule does not imply that the Owner has approved or accepted the Contractor’s means and methods or sequence for performing the work to construct the project.
	6. If the Contractor has questions or concerns about comments, the Contractor and Engineer shall meet to resolve those issues prior to issuance of future updates or revisions.
2. Quality Assurance
   1. The person preparing, updating and revising the construction Progress Schedule shall be experienced in the preparation of schedules of similar complexity.
3. Definitions
   1. The following definitions shall apply to this Specification Section:
	1. EXECUTION OF THE CONTRACT: The date the contract is signed by the last party, either the Owner or the Contractor.
	2. WORKING DAYS: Monday through Friday except holidays as directed by the Owner.
	3. BASELINE SCHEDULE: The initial detailed Progress Schedule prepared by the Contractor defining its plan for constructing the Project in accordance with the Contract Documents.
	4. SCHEDULE UPDATE: The initially accepted Baseline Schedule, or subsequently approved Revised Baseline Schedules, updated each month to reflect actual start and finish dates of each schedule activity and the remaining duration of activities that began during the period.
	5. CURRENT SCHEDULE: The current schedule is either the Baseline Schedule or Revised Baseline Schedule including and incorporating Schedule Updates.
	6. REVISED BASELINE SCHEDULE: The initially accepted Baseline Schedule revised to reflect approved contract change orders and modifications.
	7. SHORT INTERVAL SCHEDULE:
		1. Schedule prepared by the Contractor reflecting the work planned for the coming weeks.
		2. This is also known as a Look-Ahead Schedule.
	8. RESOURCES: Manpower, materials, permanent equipment, and construction equipment needed to construct the work.
