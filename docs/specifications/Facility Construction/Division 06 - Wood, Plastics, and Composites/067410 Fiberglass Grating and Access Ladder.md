      1. SECTION 06 61 00
   1. MOLDED FIBERGLASS GRATING AND ACCESS LADDERS

General
1. SCOPE
   1. This section includes the furnishing and the installing of all floor gratings and access ladders as shown on the drawings and necessary to complete the work. Grating shall include all clips, spacers, frames, fasteners and other incidental materials needed for a complete installation.
2. SUBMITTALS
   1. Submittals shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 01300 and shall include for review purposes:
      1. Samples of each type of bar gratings proposed.
2. Shop drawings.
3. Manufacturer's literature.
4. Manufacturer's certification.

## Product


* 
	1. MATERIALS
   1. Molded fiberglass grating shall be a machine made grating manufactured in a one-piece construction process of interlaced glass reinforcing strands in a resin matrix.
   1. All access ladders shall be manufactured by the pultrusion process and contain a minimum of 50 percent glass by weight. They shall be 2-inch square x 1/4-inch wall tubing with a 3/8-inch radius on the external comers.
1. All access ladder structural shapes shall be manufactured with vinyl ester as required by the surrounding environmental conditions.
	1. FABRICATION
   1. Grating:
         1. * 
	1. The floor grating shall be designed for three times a normal live load of 100 Ibs/sf, Maximum deflection under a 100 Ib/sf load within a temperature range of 20°F to 130°F shall not exceed 1/4-inch or 1/200 of the span, whichever is least.
	2. The grating shall be fabricated with a non-skid surface under wet or dry conditions. Said surface shall be flexible enough at low temperatures to prevent the nonskid surface from cracking off.
	3. Grating shall be fabricated from field dimensions taken after facilities requiring passing through the gratings are in place.
	4. Individual grating panels shall not exceed a total weight of 125Ibs unless otherwise shown or approved.
	5. Grating shall be as manufactured by McNichols or equal.
   1. Access Ladders:
      1. Access ladders shall be Enduro Composite Systems, or approved equal, non-metallic vertical ladders and attachments.
2. Ladder rungs shall be 1-inch diameter solid thermal cure rod with a non-slip surface.
3. The rung shall penetrate the wall of the side rail and be bonded and riveted to said side rail, thereby providing a structural connection that is both chemical and mechanical.

* 
	1. FRAMING
   1. Grating frames set in concrete shall be made of ¼-inch, 304 stainless steel angles. Angles shall be shop connected at comers to form a single framing unit fitting the field dimensions of the opening. Connections shall be non-mechanical. Comers shall be smooth and flush.
   1. The frames shall be anchored into surrounding concrete with stainless steel anchors.
   1. All required grating fasteners shall be stainless steel.
   1. Furnish ladder and brackets complete to attach to concrete surface.
   1. Execution
1.  

* 
	
General
   1. The gratings shall be installed in angle frames set in the concrete to support the gratings. The top surface of the gratings shall be set flush with the surface of the concrete in which it is installed. No panel shall rock when any part of it is stepped on.
2. A maximum spacing of ¼-inch shall be maintained between the grating and adjacent surfaces.
3. All cut edges shall be sealed with a catalyzed resin compatible with the original resin and recommended by the manufacturer. The sealing of the edges shall prevent premature fraying at the field cut edges. Two coats shall be applied.
1. PART 4 – SPECIAL PROVISIONS
1. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT
   1. Payment for furnishing and installing the "MOLDED FIBERGLASS GRATING" shown on the drawings and as outlined above shall be included in the lump sum price named in the Proposal under "Molded Fiberglass Grating," complete and acceptable to the Engineer.
   1. Payment for furnishing and installing the Access Ladders shown on the drawings and as outlined above shall be included in the lump sum price named in the Proposal under "Access Ladders," complete and acceptable to the Engineer.
   1. Payment indicated to include complete compensation for all labor, equipment, materials and incidentals involved in work specified under this section. No additional compensation to be allowed.
   1. Frame shall be considered incidental work, which no additional payment shall be provided.
