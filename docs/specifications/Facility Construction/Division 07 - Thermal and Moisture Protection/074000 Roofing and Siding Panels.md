   1. Remove all existing roofing down to the roof deck.
2. Verify that the deck is dry, sound, clean and smooth. It shall be free of any depressions, waves, and projections.
3. Verify that the deck is structurally sound and free of deteriorated decking. All deteriorated decking shall be removed and replaced with new materials.
4. Cover with sheet metal, all holes over 1 inch (25mm) in diameter, cracks over 1/2 inch (12mm) in width, loose knots and excessively resinous areas.
5. Replace damaged deck with new materials.
6. Clean deck surfaces thoroughly prior to installation of eaves protection membrane and underlayment.
1. 3.3 Preparation of Substrate
   1. Clean deck surfaces thoroughly prior to installation of eaves protection membrane and underlayment.
2. At areas that receive eaves protection membrane, fill knotholes and cracks with latex filler.
1. 3.4 Substrate Installation
   1. The structural roof deck shown in the plans shall be smooth and level and free of water or debris before the nail base insulation is installed. Apply vapor retarder if required.
2. Fasten with ThermaCal® or approved equal Fasteners to the supporting roof deck shown in the plans.
3. Protect nail base insulation work from exposure to moisture damage and deterioration, primarily by prompt installation of the roofing, sheet metal and waterproofing work. 
1. 3.5 Installation of Underlayments

	2. Where valleys are indicated to be "open valleys", install metal flashing over GAF® leak barrier or approved equal before roof deck protection is installed
		1. DO NOT nail through the flashing. 
		2. Secure the flashing by nailing at 18 inches (457 mm) on center just beyond edge of flashing so that nail heads hold down the edge.
4. Hips and Ridges:
      1. 
	1. Install GAF® leak barrier or approved equal along entire lengths. 
		1. If ridge vents are to be installed, position the leak barrier so that the ridge slots will not be covered.
5. Roof Deck Protection:
	1. Install one layer of GAF® leak barrier or approved equal over the entire area.
	2. Install in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.
6. Deck-Armor™ Application
	1. Deck-Armor shall be installed over a clean, dry deck.
	2. Install Weather Watch® or StormGuard® Leak Barrier at eaves, valleys, rakes, skylights, dormers and other vulnerable leak areas.
	3. Lay Deck-Armor™ over deck and overlap 3” (76mm) at side laps and 6” (152mm) at end laps. 
	4. For exposure to rain or snow, overlap 12” (305mm) at end laps.
	5. For side and end laps: fasten Deck-Armor 12” (305mm) o.c. (6” (152mm)o.c. for high wind areas).
