      1. Fasten metal wall panels to supports with fasteners at each 
lapped joint at location and spacing recommended by manufacturer.
1. Lap ribbed or fluted sheets one full rib corrugation. Apply panels and associated items 
   1. for neat and weathertight enclosure. Avoid "panel creep" or application not true to line.
2. Provide metal-backed washers under heads of exposed fasteners bearing on weather side of 
   1. metal wall panels.
3. Locate and space exposed fasteners in uniform vertical and horizontal alignment. Use 
   1. proper tools to obtain controlled uniform compression for positive seal without rupture of washer.
4. Install screw fasteners with power tools having controlled torque adjusted to compress 
   1. washer tightly without damage to washer, screw threads, or panels. Install screws in
   1. predrilled holes.
5. Provide sealant tape and flashing at lapped joints of metal wall panels and between panels 
   1. and protruding equipment, vents, and accessories. Seal all penetrations watertight.
6. Apply a continuous ribbon of sealant tape to weather-side surface of fastenings on end 
   1. laps; on side laps of nesting-type panels; on side laps of corrugated nesting-type, ribbed, or 
   1. fluted panels; and elsewhere as needed to make panels weathertight.
7. At panel splices, nest panels with minimum 6-inch end lap, sealed with butyl-rubber 
   1. sealant and fastened together by interlocking clamping plates.
2. ACCESSORY INSTALLATION

General
:
      1. Install accessories with positive anchorage to building and weathertight mounting, 
and provide for thermal expansion. Coordinate installation with flashings and other components.
1. Install components required for a complete metal wall panel assembly including trim, 
   1. copings, corners, seam covers, flashings, sealants, gaskets, fillers, closure strips, and similar 
   1. items.

      1. Comply with performance requirements, manufacturer's written 
installation instructions, and SMACNA's "Architectural Sheet Metal Manual." Provide concealed 
   1. fasteners where possible, and set units true to line and level as indicated. Install work with 
   1. laps, joints, and seams that will be permanently watertight and weather resistant.
3. CLEANING AND PROTECTION
   1. Remove temporary protective coverings and strippable films, if any, as metal wall panels 
are installed, unless otherwise indicated in manufacturer's written installation instructions. On 
   1. completion of metal wall panel installation, clean finished surfaces as recommended by metal wall 
   1. panel manufacturer. Maintain in a clean condition during construction.
   1. After metal wall panel installation, clear weep holes and drainage channels of 
obstructions, dirt, and sealant.
