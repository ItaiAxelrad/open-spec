1. FIRESTOPPING

General
   1. SUMMARY
   1. Section Includes:
      1. Firestopping shall consist of furnishing and installing a material or a combination of materials to form an effective barrier against the spread of flame, smoke, and gases, and to maintain the integrity of fire-rated construction.
   1. Firestopping shall be provided in the following locations:
      1. Duct, conduit, and pipe penetrations through above grade floor slabs and through fire-rated walls.
   1. Cracks, voids, and holes in fire-rated walls, ceilings, and floors.
   1. Other locations specifically designated on the drawings.
