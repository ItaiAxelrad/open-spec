2. Perform electrical penetrations in accordance with NFPA 70, Article 501.
3. Install sleeves and castings in accordance with ACI 318, Chapter #6.
4. Hot dip galvanize, or paint all steel sleeves installed.
5. When mechanical or electrical work cannot be installed as structure is being erected, provide and arrange for building-in of boxes, sleeves, insets, fixtures or devices necessary to permit installation later. Lay out chases, holes or other openings which must be provided in masonry, concrete or other work.
6. Where pipes, conduits or ducts pass through newly constructed floors in washdown areas, cast sleeves with top 3 IN above finish floors. In non-washdown areas, cast sleeves with ends flush with finished surfaces.
7. Size sleeves, blockouts and cutouts which will receive sealant seal such that free area to receive sealant is minimized and seal integrity may be obtained.
8. For insulated piping and ducts, size sleeves, blockouts and cutouts large enough to accommodate full thickness of insulation.
9. Do not cut into or core drill any beams, joists, or columns.
10. Do not install sleeves in beams, joists, or columns. 
11. Do not install recesses in beams, joists, columns, or slabs. 
12. Field Cutting and Coring: 
	1. Saw or core drill with non-impact type equipment. 
	2. Mark opening and drill small 3/4 IN or less holes through structure following opening outline. 
	3. Sawcut opening outline on both surfaces. Knock out within sawcuts using impact type equipment. Do not chip or spall face of surface to remain intact. Do not allow any overcut with saw kerf.
13. Precast-Prestressed Concrete Construction: 
	1. Do not cut openings nor core drill vertically or horizontally through stems of members. 
	2. Do not locate or install sleeves or recess sleeves vertically or horizontally through or in stems of members. 
	3. Cast openings and sleeves into flanges of units. 
	4. Cast openings larger than 6 IN in diameter or 6 IN maximum dimension in units at time of manufacture. 
	5. Cast openings smaller than 6 IN in diameter or 6 IN maximum dimensions in flanges of units at time of manufacture or field cut.
14. Where alterations are necessary or where new and old work join, restore adjacent surfaces to their condition existing prior to start of work. 
15. Provide waterstop plate/anchor flange for piping, ducts, castings and sleeves cast-in-place in concrete. 
	1. For fabricated units, weld plate to sleeve, pipe, or ductwork. 
	2. For commercial castings, cast water stop/anchor with wall pipe. 
	3. Plate is to be same thickness as sleeve, pipe, casting or ductwork. 
	4. For fabricated units, diameter of plate or flange to be 4 IN larger than outside diameter of sleeve, pipe or ductwork. 
	5. For commercial castings, waterstop/anchor size to be manufacturer standard. 
	6. Provide continuous around entire circumference of sleeve, pipe, or ductwork.
16. Where area is blocked out to receive sheet metal sleeve at later date: 
	1. If blockout size is sufficient to allow placement, utilize dowels for interface of initially placed concrete and sleeve encasement concrete which is placed later. 
		1. Size blockout based on sleeve size required plus 4 to 6 IN each side of sleeve for concrete encasement. 
		2. Provide #4 dowels at 12 IN spacing along each side of blockout with minimum of two dowels required per side.
	2. If blockout size is not sufficient to allow placement of dowels, provide keyway along all sides of blockout. 
		1. Size blockout based on sleeve size required plus 2 to 4 IN each side of sleeve for concrete encasement.
17. For interior wall applications where backer rod and sealant are specified, provide backer rod and sealant at each side of wall. 
18. Use full depth expanding foam sealant for seal applications into hazardous areas and applications where multiple pipes, conduits, etc. pass through single sleeve. 
19. Do not make duct or conduit penetrations below high water levels when entering or leaving tankage, wet wells, or other water holding structures. 
20. Modular Mechanical Seals:
	1. Utilize one seal for concrete thickness less than 8 IN and two seals for concrete, 8 IN thick or greater. 
	2. Utilize two seals for piping 16 IN diameter and larger if concrete thickness permits. 
	3. Install seals such that bolt heads are located on the most accessible side of the penetration.
21. Backer Rod and Sealant: 
	1. Provide backer rod and sealant for modular mechanical seal applications. Apply on top side of slab penetrations and on interior, dry side wall penetrations.
