   1. Infill Window Wall - TriFab II 451T
   1. Basic mullion size - 2" x 4 1/2"
   1. Performance:
      1. Strength:
            1. Provide system with modifications and reinforcement as necessary to withstand uniform pressures as follows:
         1. Manufacturer's responsibility includes analysis of building size, shape and location, and determination of design pressure loading for wind resistance, inward and out.
   1. Wind pressure shall be based on 140 MPH 3 second gust, plus, 120 MPH sustained wind speed.
   1. Air Infiltration Tolerance:
      1. Maximum (per bay) of 0.06 cfm per sq. ft. wall area, for 25 MPH wind, in accordance with ASTM E 283 (at 1-56 PSF for sloped glazing).
   1. Water Penetration Tolerance:
      1. No leakage for heavy rainfall with 25 MPH wind, in accordance with ASTM E331 at 6.24 PSF (at 10.0 PSF for sloped glazing).
   1. Structure Performance:
      1. Tested in accordance with ASTM E330 and based on:
            1. Maximum deflection of 1/175 of the span.
   1. Allowable stress with safety factor of 1.65.
   1. System shall perform to these criteria under a wind load consistent with 140 MPH 3 second gust and 120 MPH sustained.
   1. Aluminum Finish:
      1. Heavy integral color, clear anodized, NAAMM AAM12C22A 42/44, Provide temporary protective coating of 0.5-mil clear acrylic lacquer.
