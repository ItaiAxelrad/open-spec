General
1.  
01. SCOPE** 
   1. This section covers the work necessary to furnish and install petrolatum wax tape coating on buried ferrous materials including pipe flanges, bolted fittings and couplings, valves and other buried pipeline appurtenances, complete, as shown or specified. 
02. SUBMITTALS DURING CONSTRUCTION** 
   1. Submit manufacturer’s technical product data, details, installation instructions and general product recommendations. 
03. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION** 
   1. The use of a manufacturer’s name and model or catalog number is for the purpose of establishing the standard of quality and general configuration desired only. Products of other manufacturers will be considered in accordance with the Contract Documents. 
04. RELATED WORK SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE
   1. Standard Drawings
2. Standard Specifications 01000, 01045, 01200, 01310, 01330, 01505, 01510, 01570, 02140, 02222, 02223, 02511, 02528, 02578, 03000, 03480, 03482, 09910, and Division 15.
1. PART 2 MATERIALS** 
1. 2.01 GENERAL** 
   1.

1. 2.02 PRIMER** 
   1. Exposed surfaces shall be prime coated with a blend of petrolatum, plasticizer, and corrosion inhibitor having a paste-like consistency. The material shall have the following properties:
      1. 
   1. Pour Point 400-100° F 
   1. Flash Point 350° F minimum 
   1. Approximate Coverage 1 gal/100 square feet 
   1. Color Brown 
   1. The primer shall be Trenton Wax-Tape Primer or equivalent. 
1. 2.03 WAX TAPE** 
   1. Two types of petrolatum wax tape shall be available from the manufacturer:

   1. Buried Installations:
      1. The covering material shall be a plastic-fiber felt tape, saturated with a blend of petrolatum, plasticizers, and corrosion inhibitors that is easily formable over irregular surfaces. The tape shall have the following properties:
      1. 
   1. Color Brown 
   1. Saturant Pour Point 115° - 125°F 
   1. Thickness 70-90 mils 
   1. Dielectric Strength 170 volts/mil 
   1. Tape Width 6 inches 
   1. Wax tape shall be Wax-Tape #1 as manufactured by The Trenton Corporation (Ann Arbor, Michigan), or approved equal. 
1. 2.04 OUTER COVERING**

      1. 
   1. Width 6 inches 
   1. Thickness 1.5 mils 
   1. Dielectric Strength 2000 volts/mil 
   1. Water Absorption Negligible 
   1. Color Clear 
   1. The outer covering shall be Trenton Poly-Ply or approved equal. 
1. 2.05 OTHER PETROLATUM WAX TAPE SYSTEM COMPONENTS** 
   1. Any components not listed above, but required for a complete petrolatum wax tape coating system as recommended for this application by the manufacturer shall be provided at no additional cost to Owner. 
1. 

## Execution
