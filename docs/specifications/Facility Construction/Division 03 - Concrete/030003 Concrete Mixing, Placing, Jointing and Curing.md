		5. Obtain manufacturer's field technical assistance as required to assure proper placement.
	4. **Curing and Protection
16. Protect concrete from premature drying, excessively hot or cold temperatures, and mechanical injury immediately after placement, and maintain with minimal moisture loss at relatively constant temperature for period necessary for hydration of cement, hardening, and compressive strength gain.
	1. Follow recommendations of ACI 308.1 except as modified herein.
	2. All traffic shall be kept from the surface as necessary to protect the concrete but not less than the first 48 HRS of curing.
17. Apply one of the following curing procedures immediately after completion of placement and finishing (surfaces not in contact with forms).
	1. Ponding or continuous sprinkling. Take care to avoid eroding the surface of freshly placed concrete.
	2. Application of wet Absorbent Covers:
		1. Minimum lap: 12 IN.
		2. Provide continuous uniform supply of moisture, such as sprinklers or soaker hoses as required to keep concrete surface continuously wet.
		3. Monitor Absorbent Covers as required to prevent cover materials or concrete surface from drying out.
	3. Application of sand kept continuously wet.
	4. Continuous application of steam (not exceeding 150 Degrees Fahrenheit) or mist spray.
	5. Application of Moisture Retaining Cover sheet materials.
		1. Place as soon as possible after final finishing and without marring the surface.
		2. Minimum lap: 12 IN.
		3. Seal all edges to make water-tight.
		4. Place Moisture Retaining Cover in intimate contact with the concrete surface, without wrinkles and weighted to hold in place.
		5. Hold cover and edges in place as required to prevent wind from displacing the cover.
		6. Moisture Retaining Fabric:
			1. Install in accordance with manufacturer’s written recommendations.
			2. Saturate concrete surface and fabric side of cover immediately prior to placing.
		7. Monitor continuously during the curing period:
			1. Repair any holes, tears or displaced cover.
			2. Rewet as required to keep concrete moist under cover.
	6. Application of other moisture retaining covering as approved by Engineer.
	7. Water used for curing shall be within 20 Degrees Fahrenheit of the concrete temperature.
	8. Application of a curing compound.
		1. Apply curing compound in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations immediately after any water sheen, which may develop after finishing, has disappeared from concrete surface.
		2. Do not use on any surface against which additional concrete or other material is to be bonded unless it is proven that curing compound will not prevent bond.
		3. Where a vertical surface is cured with a curing compound, the vertical surface shall be covered with a minimum of two (2) coats of the curing compound.
			1. Apply the first coat of curing compound to a vertical surface immediately after form removal.
			2. The vertical concrete surface at the time of receiving the first coat shall be damp with no free water on the surface.
			3. Allow the preceding coat to completely dry prior to applying the next coat.
			4. A vertical surface: any surface steeper than 1:4.
		4. Curing compounds shall be non-toxic and taste and odor free, and NSF approved.
	9. Surfaces In Contact with Forms:
		1. Formed surfaces: Cure formed concrete surfaces utilizing final curing methods per ACI 308.1, including underside of beams, supported slabs, and other similar surfaces,
			1. See Specification Section 03 11 00.
		2. Minimize moisture loss from and temperature gain of concrete placed in forms exposed to heating by sun by keeping forms wet and cool until they can be safely removed.
		3. Make provisions to keep concrete wall moist while stripping forms and until curing measures are in place.
		4. After form removal, cure concrete until end of time prescribed.
		5. Use one of the methods listed above.
		6. Forms left in place shall not be used as a method of curing in hot weather.
18. Curing Period:
	1. Continue curing for at least seven (7) days for all concrete except Type III, high early strength concrete for which period shall be at least three (3) days.
		1. If one of curing procedures indicated above is used initially, it may be replaced by one of other procedures indicated any time after concrete is (7) days old, provided concrete is not permitted to become surface dry during transition.
19. Cold Weather:
	1. Follow recommendations of ACI 306.1.
	2. Maintain temperature of concrete per ACI 306.1 for a minimum of 72 HRs after concrete is placed, when outdoor temperature is 40 Degrees Fahrenheit, or less.
		1. Maximum temperature rate of decrease: Per ACI 306.1.
	3. Use heating, covering, insulating, or housing of the concrete work to maintain required temperature without injury due to concentration of heat.
	4. Do not use combustion heaters unless precautions are taken to prevent exposure of concrete to exhaust gases which contain carbon dioxide.
	5. Interior slabs in areas intended to be heated shall be adequately protected so that frost does not develop in the supporting subgrade.
20. Hot Weather:
	1. Follow recommendations of ACI 305.1 and ACI 308.1.
	2. Make provision for cooling forms, reinforcement and concrete, windbreaks, shading, fog spraying, sprinkling, ponding, or wet covering with a light colored material.
	3. Provide protective measures as quickly as concrete hardening and finishing operations will allow.
	4. Maximum temperature rate of decrease: Per ACI 305.1.
21. Rate of Temperature Change:
	1. Keep changes in temperature of air immediately adjacent to concrete as uniform as possible, during and immediately following curing period.
22. Protection from Mechanical Injury:
	1. Protect concrete from damaging mechanical disturbances, such as load stresses, heavy shock, and excessive vibration.
	2. Protect finished concrete surfaces from damage by construction equipment, materials, or methods, and by rain or running water.
	3. Do not load self-supporting structures in such a way as to overstress concrete.
