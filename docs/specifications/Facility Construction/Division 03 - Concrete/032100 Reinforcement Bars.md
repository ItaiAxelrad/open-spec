Execution
1. 3.1 Installation
   1. Tolerances:
	1. Rebar placement:
		1. Clear distance to formed surfaces: +1/4 IN.
		2. Minimum spacing between bars: -1/4 IN.
		3. Top bars in slabs and beams:
			1. Members 8 IN deep or less: +1/4 IN.
			2. Members between 8 IN and 2 FT deep: -1/4 IN, +1/2 IN.
			3. Members more than 2 FT deep: -1/4 IN, +1 IN.
		4. Crosswise of members: Spaced evenly within +1 IN.
		5. Lengthwise of members: +2 IN.
	2. Minimum clear distances between rebars:
		1. Beams, walls and slabs: Distance equal to rebar diameter or 1 IN, whichever is greater.
		2. Columns: Distance equal to 1-1/2 times the rebar diameter or 1-1/2 IN, whichever is greater.
		3. Beam and slab rebars shall be threaded through the column vertical rebars without displacing the column vertical rebars and still maintaining the clear distances required for the beam and slab rebars.
2. Minimum concrete protective covering for reinforcement:
      1. As shown on Drawings.
3. Unless indicated otherwise on Drawings, provide splice lengths for reinforcing as follows:
	1. At splices, lap bars a minimum of 38 diameters.
	2. At corner and intersections, make horizontal continuous or provide matching corner bars. 
	3. Around openings in walls or slabs, provide (2) epoxy bars extending a minimum of 2 feet beyond the edge of the opening. 
	4. Continuous top bars in walls shall be spliced at mid-span. 
	5. Continuous bottom bars in walls shall be spliced at supports. 
	6. Provide splices of reinforcing not specifically indicated or specified subject to approval of Engineer.
4. Welding:
	1. Do not weld reinforcing unless specifically required in the Drawings or without approval of the Engineer for locations not noted in the Drawings.
	2. Perform welding of rebars in accordance with requirements of AWS D1.4.
5. Placing Rebars:
	1. Assure that reinforcement at time concrete is placed is free of mud, oil or other materials that may affect or reduce bond.
	2. Reinforcement with rust, mill scale or a combination of both will be accepted as being satisfactory without cleaning or brushing provided dimensions and weights including heights of deformations on a cleaned sample is not less than required by applicable ASTM specification that governs for the rebar supplied.
	3. Reinforcing support:
		1. Uncoated reinforcing:
			1. Support reinforcing and fasten together to prevent displacement by construction operations.
				1. Locate and support reinforcement with bar supports to maintain minimum concrete cover.
				2. Set wire ties with ends directed into concrete, not toward exposed concrete surfaces.
				3. Reinforcement shown on the Contract Documents may not be repositioned for use a support for reinforcement. Additional drop bars may be provided for support of reinforcing,
			2. Reinforcing supported on ground:
				1. Slab on grade and other members with only one mat of reinforcing:
      1. Provide metal bar supports with bottom plate.
   1. Do not use concrete blocks to support slab-on-grade reinforcing.

* 
	+ 
		- 
			* 
				1. All other members: Provide supporting concrete blocks or metal bar supports with bottom plate.
			1. Reinforcing supported on formwork:
				1. Concrete surfaces in contact with or over process liquid: All-Plastic chairs, runners and bar supports.
				2. All other formed surfaces:
      1. Provide plastic-coated metal chairs, runners, bolsters, spacers, hangers and other reinforcing support.
   1. Only tips in contact with the forms need to be plastic coated.

* 
	1. Where parallel horizontal reinforcement in beams is indicated to be placed in two or more layers, rebars in the upper layers shall be placed directly above rebars in the bottom layer with clear distance between layers to be 1 IN.
		1. Place spacer rebars at 3 FT maximum centers to maintain the required 1 IN clear distance between layers.
	2. Extend reinforcement to within 2 IN of concrete perimeter edges.
		1. If perimeter edge is formed by earth or stay-in-place forms, extend reinforcement to within 3 IN of the edge.
	3. To assure proper placement, furnish templates for all column vertical bars and dowels.
	4. Do not bend reinforcement after embedding in hardened concrete unless approved by Engineer.
		1. Do not bend reinforcing by means of heat.
	5. Do not tack weld reinforcing.
	6. Embed rebars into hardened concrete utilizing adhesive anchor system specifically manufactured for such installation:
		1. Drill hole in concrete with diameter and depth as required to develop 125 percent of the yield strength of the bar according to manufacturer's requirements.
		2. Clean holes per manufacturer's recommendations.
		3. Place adhesive in drilled hole.
		4. Insert rebar into hole and adhesive in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
1. 3.2 Quality Control
   1. Reinforcement Congestion and Interferences:
	1. Notify Engineer whenever the specified clearances between rebars cannot be met.
	2. Do not place any concrete until the Engineer submits a solution to rebar congestion problem.
	3. Rebars may be moved as necessary to avoid interference with other reinforcing steel, conduits, or embedded items.
	4. If rebars are moved more than one bar diameter, obtain Engineer's approval of resulting arrangement of rebars.
	5. No cutting of rebars shall be done without written approval of Engineer.
