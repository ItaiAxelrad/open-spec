   287. Replace precast concrete units which do not meet specified requirements, including strength, tolerances, and finishes, as directed by the Architect. The Contractor also shall be responsible for the coast of corrections to other work affected by defective precast units.
   288. Strength:
      16. Precast units may be considered potentially deficient and may require further testing for any factor likely to affect their performance, including the following:
      17. Failure to meet requirements of compressive strength tests.
   289. Failure to meet absorption criteria.
   290. Failure to meet requirements for pretensioning and detensioning of tendons for prestressed concrete.
   291. Improper curing or failure to protect units against extremes in temperature.
   292. Damage to units during transportation, handling, or erection.
   293. Verification Testing
   294. When strength of precast units is suspect, the Owner may employ a separate testing laboratory to take cores of hardened concrete per ASTM C42 at locations directed by the Architect, and as follows:
      18. Take at least 3 representative cores.
   295. Test cores per ACI 318; saturated but surface dry condition for units which will be wet during use in completed structure; air-dry conditions for precast units which will be dry during use.
   296. Report test results same day as tests are made. Include in test report the following information:
      19. Project identification; date; name of precast fabricator; identification letter, name, and type of member represented by cores tested; design compressive strength; compression breaking strength and type of break (corrected for length-diameter ratio); direction of applied load to core; and moisture condition of core at time of test.
   297. Strength of concrete will be considered acceptable in each case if average compressive strength of cores is at least 85 percent of 28-day design compressive strength.
   298. Where core tests have indicated satisfactory strength, fill core holes solid with patching mortar and finish to match adjacent concrete surfaces.
   299. EXECUTION
   300. examination
   301. Examine substrate and conditions for compliance with the requirements for installation tolerances, true and level bearing surfaces, inserts and anchors in supporting Work and other conditions affecting performance. Do not proceed with Work until unsatisfactory conditions are corrected.
   302. Do not install precast concrete units until supporting concrete work has attained minimum design compressive strength.
   303. installation

General
   1. Provide temporary supports and bracing required to maintain position, stability, and alignment as units are being permanently connected.
   2. Follow all Federal, state, and local regulations during precast erection.
   3. Installation
   4. Install precast concrete units straight, plumb and in alignment, and securely anchored to the structural framing without exceeding the erection and location tolerance of PCI MNL 117, Appendix I.
   5. Install bearing pads as precast concrete units are being erected.
   6. Install members with suitable lifting devices at points provided by the manufacturer without damage to shape and finish.
   7. Maintain horizontal and vertical joint alignment and uniform joint width as indicated on drawings as erection progresses.
   8. Maintain surfaces of joints to be weatherproofed clean and as approved by sealant manufacturer.
   9. Sequence precast concrete unit installation with installation of flashing and weeps.
   10. Anchor precast concrete units in position by bolting, welding, grouting or as otherwise indicated on shop drawings. Remove temporary shims, wedges, and spacers after anchoring and grouting are completed.
   11. Welding:
      1. Perform welding in compliance with AWS D1.1 and AWS D1.4 with qualified welders.
   12. Protect precast concrete units and bearing pads for damages by field welding or cutting operation and provide noncombustible shields as required.
   13. Weld equipment, materials and process to be compatible with base metal.
   14. Repair damaged steel surfaces by cleaning and applying a coat of liquid galvanizing repair compound as per, ASTM A780 to galvanized surfaces and a coat of compatible primer on painted surfaces.
   15. Bolting
   16. At bolted connection, use lock washers or other acceptable means to prevent loosing of nuts.
   17. Grouting
   18. Grout connections where indicated on shop drawings or where required.
   19. Retain grout in place until hard enough to support it self. Pack spaces with stiff grout material until voids are completely filled. Place grout to finish smooth, level and plumb with adjacent concrete surfaces. Promptly remove gout material from exposed surfaces before it affects finishes or hardens.
   20. Keep grouted joints damp for not less than 24 hours after initial set.
   21. Damaged Units
   22. Do not install units having broken corners or edges, spalls, cracks or other defects in the Work. Remove units erected and later found to be broken, spalled, cracked or otherwise damaged, and replace with approved units matching the adjacent work, unless patching of minor defects is approved in writing.
   23. Final Cleaning
   24. After installation and joint treatment clean soiled precast concrete surfaces, starting at the top of the structure, with detergent and water, using fiber brush and sponge, and rinse thoroughly with clean water in accordance with precast concrete manufacturer's recommendation. Use cleaning materials or processes which will not change the character of exposed concrete finishes.
   25. Use extreme care to prevent damage to precast concrete surfaces and to adjacent materials.
   26. Rinse thoroughly with clean water immediately after using cleaner.
