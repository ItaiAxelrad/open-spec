   1. demolished and that maintain continuity of service to other buildings and structures.
3. Cut off pipe or conduit a minimum of 24 inches below grade. Cap, valve, or plug and
   1. seal remaining portion of pipe or conduit after bypassing according to requirements of
   1. authorities having jurisdiction.
   1. Temporary Shoring:
      1. Provide and maintain interior and exterior shoring, bracing, or structural
support to preserve stability and prevent unexpected movement or collapse of construction
