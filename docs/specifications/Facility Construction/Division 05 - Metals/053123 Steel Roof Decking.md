## Execution

1. INSTALLATION

General
:
      1. Install deck units and accessories in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations
and final shop drawings, and as specified herein.
1. Replace all sheets that have been crimped, dented or bent during shipping or erection or
   1. because of like damage from other construction operations.
   1. Place deck units on supporting steel framework and adjust to final position with ends accurately
aligned and bearing on supporting members not less than 3" before being permanently fastened.
   1. Do not stretch or contract side lap interlocks.
   1. Place deck units in straight alignment for entire length of run of cells and with close alignment
between cells at ends of abutting units. Check alignment every 30 feet to prevent fanning due to
   1. tolerance in sheet width and in placement.
   1. Place deck units flat and square, secured to adjacent framing without excessive warp or
      1. Check flatness with a 4-foot straightedge and adjust or replace deck when there is a
space of more than 1/16" between the straight edge and the upper surface.
   1. Coordinate and cooperate with structural steel erector in locating decking bundles to prevent
overloading of structural members.
   1. Do not use deck units for storage or working platforms until permanently secured and then for
no more than the load capacity of the deck or support framing, whichever is less.
   1. Fastening Deck Units:
      1. Fasten deck units to steel with self-drilling No. 12 or larger screws; or, powder-actuated
   1. or pneumatically-driven fasteners which penetrate supporting members; or, by welding
   1. through deck to structural steel with not less than 5/8" diameter fusion welds or elongated
   1. welds of equal strength. Use a minimum of two fasteners or welds per unit at each
   1. support, spaced not more than 12" o.c. along perimeter of building and openings and at
   1. every support and at each brace line, and at closer spacing where required for lateral and
   1. uplift force resistance. In addition, secure deck to each supporting member in ribs where
   1. side laps occur. Connect split or partial panels or filler sheets to the structure in every
   1. valley regardless of adjacent fastener pattern.
2. Comply with SDI and manufacturer's procedure and recommendations for mechanical
   1. fastener installation.
      1. Install screws exercising care to assure good contact between connected parts. Do
not overdrive screw causing stripped threads or damaged screw heads. Remove
   1. any screw damaged due to overdriving and replace at an adjacent location.
      1. Do not overdrive powder-actuated or pneumatically-driven fasteners causing
rebound or damage to surface coatings.
3. Comply with AWS requirements and procedures for manual shielded metal arc welding,
   1. appearance and quality of welds, and methods used in correcting welding work.
      1. Use proper rods and power to produce sound, full-size welds without excessive
burning or damage to the structural steel.
4. Mechanically fasten side laps of adjacent deck units between supports, at intervals not
   1. exceeding 36" o.c., using self-drilling No. 10 Tek or larger screws.
   1. Cutting and Fitting:
      1. Cut and neatly fit deck units and accessories around other work projecting
through or adjacent to the decking.
   1. Repair or replace deck where non-usable holes have been made in the deck through accident or
carelessness during erection, or for any other reason, which are larger than 1/4" in diameter as
   1. follows:
         1. 1/4" to 1/2" Diameter:
      1. Seal with joint tape.
2. 1/2" to 1" Diameter:
      1. Seal with 26-gage minimum sheet metal fastened with epoxy
   1. adhesive.
3. 1" to 2" Diameter:
      1. Seal with 26-gage minimum sheet metal fastened with self-drilling
   1. screws or blind rivets.
4. 2" Diameter or Larger:
      1. Replace deck unit.
   1. Reinforcement at Openings:
      1. Provide additional metal reinforcement and closure pieces as
required for strength, continuity of decking and support of other work.
1. Holes less than 6" across require no reinforcement. Reinforce holes 6" to 12" across with
   1. 20-gage galvanized steel sheet at least 12" wider and longer than the opening and
   1. fastened to the steel deck at a maximum of 12" on center. Reinforce openings larger than
   1. 12" across with steel angles as shown on the Drawings. Provide fasteners at each corner
   1. and spaced not more than 9" o.c. along each side.
   1. Closure Strips:
      1. Provide metal closure strips at open uncovered ends and edges of decking, and
in voids between decking and other construction. Tack weld, or use self-drilling No. 10 Tek or
   1. larger screws, at 4'-0" o.c.
   1. Touch-Up Painting:
      1. After decking installation, wire brush, clean and paint scarred areas, welds
and rust spots on top and bottom surfaces of decking units and supporting steel members.
1. Touch-up galvanized surfaces with galvanizing repair paint applied in accordance with
   1. manufacturer's instructions.
