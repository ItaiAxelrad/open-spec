   1. SINGLE AUTOMATIC PUSH BUTTON OPERATION:
      1. The elevator shall be controlled automatically by means of push buttons in the car marked to correspond with the respective landings served, and by single "Call" buttons at each hoistway opening. The momentary pressure of any button shall operate the car, if all car and hoistway doors are closed. The car shall travel to its destination in the direction chosen without interference. After the car has been placed in motion, all other push buttons shall become inoperative until the car has reached the designated landing. A time delay, non-interference feature shall be incorporated in the control circuit to allow ample time for opening car and hoistway doors before the car can be dispatched to another landing. An emergency stop switch shall be provided in the car push-button station which, when in the off position, will render the elevator inoperative, and which will enable attendant or passenger to stop the car at any point during its travel. Each landing station shall contain "In-Use" signal lights to indicate that the car is in motion and that it cannot be called until it has completed the registered call at which time the "In-Use" signal light will be extinguished, and the car will be available to answer the next call registered.

The starter shall include a current limit adjustment range of 200% to 450% of the overload adjustment range. Provide an internal fault detection system. If the internal fault detection system detects a failure power shall be removed from the motor.
   1. FAILURE PROTECTION:
      1. The electrical control circuit shall be designed so that if a malfunction should occur, due to motor starter failure, oil becoming low in the system, or the car failing to reach a landing in the up direction within a predetermined time, the elevator car will automatically descend to the lowest terminal loading. If power operated doors are used, the doors will automatically open when the car reaches that landing to allow passengers to depart. The doors will then automatically close and all control buttons, except the "door open" button in the car station, shall be made inoperative.
   1. AUTOMATIC SELF-LEVELING:
      1. The elevator shall be provided with a self-leveling feature that will automatically bring the car to the floor landings. This self-leveling shall, within its zone, be entirely automatic and independent of the operating device and shall correct for overtravel or undertravel. The car shall also be maintained approximately level with the landing irrespective of the load.
   1. AUTOMATIC TERMINAL LIMITS:

      1. Relief Valve shall be externally adjustable, and shall be capable of bypassing the total oil flow without increasing back pressure more than 50% above working pressure.
   1. Up Start and Stop Valve shall be externally adjustable, and designed to bypass oil flow during start and stop of motor pump assembly. Valve shall close slowly, gradually diverting oil to or from the Jack Unit, insuring smooth up starts and up stops.
   1. Check Valve shall be designed to close quietly and without permitting any perceptible reverse flow.
   1. Lowering Valve and Leveling Valve shall be externally adjustable for drop-away speed, lowering speed, leveling speed and stopping speed to insure smooth "Down" starts and stops. The leveling valve shall be designed to level the car to the floor in the direction the car is traveling when slowdown is initiated.
