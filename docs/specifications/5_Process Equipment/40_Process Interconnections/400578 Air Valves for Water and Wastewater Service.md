1. COMBINATION AIR VALVES FOR WATER
1. 
## General

01. DESCRIPTION
   1. This section includes the materials and installation instructions to cover the design, manufacture, and testing of 1 and 2 inch combination Air Valves for working pressures up to 250 psig designed specifically for use in water transmission applications.
   1. Combination Air Valves shall be float operated valves designed to release accumulated air or gas from a piping system while the system is in operation and under pressure. In addition the valves shall discharge large quantities of air during pipe filling operations and intake large quantities of air during pipe draining and water column separation conditions.
02. REFERENCE STANDARDS
   1. The publications listed below form part of this specification to the extent referenced and are referred to in the text by the basic designation only. Reference shall be made to the latest edition of said standards unless otherwise called for. 
   1. The valve manufacturer shall have ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications. 
2. The valve shall have NSF 61 certification for potable water applications. 
03. RELATED WORK SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE
   1. Standard Drawings
2. Standard Specifications 01000, 01045, 01200, 01310, 01330, 01505, 01510, 01570, 02140, 02222, 02223, 02511, 02528, 02578, 03000, 03480, 03482, 09902, 09910, and Division 15.
04. DESIGN
   1. The valve shall have a single float design and shall be designed to ensure a drip tight sealing at system operation pressure as low as 3 psig.
2. The float shall operate in concert with a rolling seal design that creates the closure of the valve preventing water from escaping the valve at system operation under pressure of 3 psig and higher, while being able to automatically adjust its position to allow for controlled intermittent air release. Valves that do not incorporate the rolling seal solution shall not be considered equal or acceptable. Valve designs that do not intentionally allow for intermittent release of air during operation shall not be considered equal or acceptable.
3. Air flow alone will not prematurely shut the valve at pressure lower than 9 psig.
4. The valve shall have a (1/2) (3/4) (1) (2) inch male NPT connection inlet as indicated on the drawings. In addition the valve shall have a 1-1/2 inch NPT connection for attaching a vent pipe. (Alternate inlet and venting sizes are available. Please consult with your local authorized representative for appropriate size combinations).
5. The sealing pressure shall be 3 psi and the working pressure shall be 250 psi, while the maximum working temperature shall be 140 degrees F, with maximum intermittent temperatures of up to 194 degrees F. Air valves which are not rated for minimum sealing pressure of 3 psi and maximum working pressure of 250 psi shall not be considered equal or acceptable. 
6. The reinforced nylon valve weight shall be 10 lb. or less. Valves in excess of 10 lb. shall not be considered equal or acceptable.
05. TESTING
   1. All valves supplied under this section shall be hydraulically tested to a minimum pressure of 360 psi. Valves which are not tested to a minimum pressure of 360 psi shall not be considered equal or acceptable.
05. MANUFACTURER
   1. All valve manufacturers shall have a minimum of Ten (10) years’ experience in manufacturing air valves for water and wastewater applications.
2. All air valves shall be accompanied by a written Five (5) year warranty.
3. All combination air valves shall be model ARI D-040 as manufactured by ARI or approved equal.
4. All valves shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations and the installation shall include an isolation valve for control and valve maintenance.
1. PART 2 MATERIALS
1. 2.01 COMBINATION AIR VALVES
   1. The valve body shall be constructed of NSF certified reinforced nylon. Valves constructed of cast iron or ductile iron shall not be considered equal or acceptable. Valves that do not carry and maintain the applicable NSF certification(s) shall not be considered equal or acceptable. (Alternate materials of construction are available. Please consult with your local authorized representative for appropriate material combinations).
2. The float shall be constructed of polypropylene.
3. The rolling seal shall be constructed of EPDM rubber and provide smooth positive opening, closing, and leak free sealing over the range of pressures 3 psi and higher, that the system may experience, including static system pressure. For lower minimum sealing pressures, other rubber materials are available.
4. All metal hardware shall be 316 stainless steel. All O-rings shall be of BUNA-N with pressure ratings equivalent to the overall working pressure of the valve.
