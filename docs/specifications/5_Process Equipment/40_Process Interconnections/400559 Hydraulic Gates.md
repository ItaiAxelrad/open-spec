All contact surfaces of the frame shall be machined. The frame shall have machined dovetailed grooves on the front face into which bronze seat facings shall be driven and machined to a 63 micro-inch finish. The back of the frame shall be machined to bolt directly to the machined face of a wall thimble, or pipe flange. Frames for sluice gates, greater than 24" wide, subject to unseating heads shall have integrally cast pads machined with keyways to receive top and bottom wedge seats.
		2. Disc or Slide: The disc shall be of cast iron, one-piece construction, rectangular with integrally cast vertical and horizontal ribs. A reinforcing rib along each side shall be provided to insure rigidity between the side wedges. The disc shall have machined dovetailed grooves on the seating face into which bronze seat facings shall be driven and machined to a 63 micro-inch finish. A tongue on each side, extending the full length of the disc, shall be machined on all sides with a 1/16" clearance maintained between the disc tongue and gate guide groove. Wedge pads for side, top, and bottom wedges, when required, shall be cast integrally on the disc and machined to receive adjustable bronze wedges. A heavily reinforced nut pocket shall be cast integrally on the vertical centerline and above the horizontal center, and be of such shape to receive the square-backed thrust nut.
		3. Guides: The guides shall be cast iron, one-piece, designed to withstand the total thrust due to water pressure and the wedging action. The guides shall be machined on all contact surfaces, and a groove shall be machined the entire length of the guide to allow 1/16" clearance between the disc tongue and guide groove. The guides shall be of such length as to retain and support at least one half the disc in the full open position. The guides shall be integrally cast with or attached to the frame with silicon bronze or stainless steel studs and nuts, and shall be dowelled to prevent any relative motion between the guides and frame. On sluice gates over 48" wide, a reinforcing rib extending from the guide flange over the top of the wedge seat shall be provided. Bronze wedge seats shall be securely attached to machined pads on the guides.
		4. Wedges: The wedges shall be solid cast bronze, machined on all contact surfaces. They shall be attached to the disc with studs and nuts and shall have adjusting screws with lock nuts.
		5. Seat Facings: All seat facings shall be malleable extruded bronze of a composition which shall increase in wearing ability with cold working. The extruded seat facings shall be of special shape to fill and permanently lock in the machined dovetailed grooves when driven into place. Attaching pins and screws shall not be allowed. The installed seat facings shall be machined to a 63 micro-inch finish or better.
		6. Wall Thimbles: Wall thimbles shall be furnished for all sluice gates that are not attached to pipe flanges. Wall thimbles shall be section “F”, section “E”, or Mechanical Joint. The depth shall be as indicated on the plans and listed in the Gate Schedule. They shall be cast iron, one- piece construction of adequate section to withstand all operational and reasonable installation stresses. Wall thimbles shall be internally braced during concrete placement. A center ring or water stop shall be cast around the periphery of the thimble. The front flange shall be machined and have tapped holes for the sluice gate attaching studs, and metal stamped vertical centerlines with the word “top” for correct alignment. Large rectangular wall thimbles shall be provided with holes in the invert to allow air to escape during concrete placement beneath the thimble. A permanent gasket for uniform thickness or suitable mastic shall be provided between the sluice gate and wall thimble.
		7. Stems: The operating stem shall be of a size to safely withstand, without buckling or permanent distortion, the stresses induced by normal operating forces. In addition, the stem shall be designed to transmit in compression at least 2-1/2 times the rated output of the floorstand or benchstand with a 40 pound effort on the crank or handwheel. The threaded portion of the stem shall have machine cut threads of the 29°Acme type. Stems of more than one section shall be joined by bronze couplings threaded and keyed to the stems. All threaded and keyed couplings of the same size shall be interchangeable. Manually operated, rising stem gates shall be provided with an adjustable stop collar on the stem above the floorstand lift nut.
			1. Stem Cover: ASTM D707 clear butyrate, with caps, condensation vents, and 1-inch graduations to indicate gate positions.
		8. Stem Guides: Stem guides shall be cast iron, bronze bushed, mounted on cast iron brackets. They shall be adjustable in two directions and shall be spaced at sufficient intervals to adequately support the stem. Stem guide spacing shall not exceed and L/r ratio of 200, and shall not be spaced greater than 10 feet except where required by gate travel.
		9. Flush Bottom Closure
			1. The flush bottom closure type of gate shall have a compressible resilient seal attached to the bottom of the disc (sliding member) with a stainless steel bar and fasteners. The seal shall be of a specially extruded shape, and designed to accurately fit to the bottom rib of the disc. The seal shall be shaped to produce a wide sealing area on a machined cast iron stop bar that is bolted to the gate frame to form a flush invert. The differential sealing pressure of the resilient seal on the stop bar shall be variable by adjustment of the side wedges on the gate.
		10. Self-Contained Gates
			1. The self-contained sluice gate shall have extended side guides to allow the gate to fully open. The heavily designed cast iron or structural steel yoke, attached to machined pads on the side/guides, shall have a machined bearing surface for the stem thrust collar or a mounting plate for the operator. The gate operating thrust shall be transferred to the yoke by the stem thrust collar or operator. The threaded operating stem shall be bronze or stainless steel and furnished as part of the sluice gate assembly.
			2. The self-contained sluice gates shall be arranged for rising stem operation. Operation shall be by motor operated benchstand. A bronze thrust nut in a nut pocket at the top of the disc shall engage in the stem threads and open and close the gate disc as it travels up or down the operating stem. The stem shall not project into the clear opening of the sluice gate.
		11. Manually Operated Floorstands
			1. Manual operation shall be by crank operated floorstand, as indicated on the plans and specified in the Gate Schedule.
			2. Crank operated type shall have either single or double gear reduction depending upon the lifting capacity required. It shall be provided with a threaded cast bronze lift nut to engage the operating stem. Roller bearings shall be provided above and below a flange on the operating nut to support both opening and closing thrusts.
			3. Floorstands shall operate the gates under the specified operating head with not greater than a 40 pound pull on the crank or handwheel. Gears shall be steel with machine-cut teeth designed for smooth operation. The stainless steel pinion shafts on crank operated floorstands, whether single or double ratio, shall be supported on tapered roller bearings or needle bearings. All components shall be totally enclosed in a cast iron case and cover. Positive mechanical seals shall be provided on the operating nut, and the pinion shaft is to exclude moisture and dirt and prevent leakage of lubricant out of the hoist. Lubricating fittings shall be provided for the lubrication of all gears and bearings. Removable crank shall be designed for rough treatment and minimum weight.
			4. Floorstands shall include a high strength pedestal designed to position the input, shaft, or handwheel approximately 36" above the operating floor. Benchstands shall be provided with a rectangular cast iron base machined and drilled for mounting purposes. An arrow with the word "open" shall be permanently attached or cast on the floorstand, benchstand, or handwheel indicating the direction of rotation to open the gate.
		12. Operator: Electric gate operator – see Section 409213.
		13. Painting
			1. The gate manufacturer shall be responsible for shop prime and finish painting of all gates and appurtenances supplied under this contract. All coatings shall conform with VOC Emission Regulations in effect at the manufacturing location and at project site to allow touch-up or recoating to be performed with the same products.
		14. Leakage
			1. The sluice gates shall be substantially watertight under design head conditions. The leakage shall not exceed 0.1 gpm per foot of periphery for seating heads up to 50 feet, and for unseating heads up to 30 feet.
		15. Shop Testing
