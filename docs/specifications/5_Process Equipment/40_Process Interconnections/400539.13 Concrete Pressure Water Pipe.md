      appropriate certification.

## Execution

### INSTALLATION

1. Pipe shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s written instructions. Trench width
   and bedding shall be as shown on the drawings.
2. Before laying each joint of pipe, the bell and spigot shall be thoroughly cleaned by wire
   brushing and wiping until clan and dry. The bell, spigot and joint gasket shall be lubricated
3. with a nontoxic water-soluble lubricant. The gasket shall be placed in the spigot grove and
4. tension in the gasket shall be equalized by inserting a smooth round rod under the gasket and
5. moving it completely around the circumference of the joint. The spigot end of the pipe shall be
6. centered with the bell of the last, previously laid pipe and pushed into position. Following
7. assembly, the pipe joint shall be checked with a feeler gauge to ensure the gasket remains seated
8. in the spigot groove. If the gasket is found to be displaced, the joint shall be removed, the
9. gasket inspected, the joint re-laid, and the gasket position rechecked. The joint shall then be
10. checked to assure the proper amount of joint engagement has been achieved. Upon completion
11. of the pipe jointing, the interior of the pipe shall be cleaned of all debris.
12. The interior joints shall be pointed with Portland cement mortar. Prior to placing of mortar, any
    dirt or trash which has collected in the joint shall be cleaned out and surface of the joint space
13. shall be moistened with water by spraying or brushing with a wet brush. The joint recess shall
14. be filled with mortar and finished smooth after the joint is engaged. Careful inspection shall be
15. made of each joint to insure a smooth, continuous interior surface.
16. The exterior joints shall be protected with Portland cement mortar. Prior to placing of mortar,
    any dirt or trash which has collected in the joint shall be cleaned out and surface of the joint
17. space shall be moistened with water by spraying or brushing with a wet brush. A grout band
18. shall be placed around the pipe and positioned to straddle the joint recess. The band shall be of
19. sufficient length to essentially encircle the pipe and shall be secured in such a manner that the
20. joint mortar will be contained with little or no leakage. For raised bell pipe, there shall be no
21. additional bedding or backfill material placed on either side of the pipe until after the mortar
22. band is filled and the mortar has mechanically stiffened. The band shall be completely filled
23. with mortar in one operation by filling from one side only until the mortar rises on the opposite
24. side, and then rodded or agitated on both sides of the pipe alternatively to settle the mortar. The
25. mortar shall then not be agitated for at least 15 minutes to allow excess water to seep through
26. the grout band and to allow the mortar to mechanically stiffen. After this period, more mortar
27. shall be added, if necessary, to fill the joint completely. The gap at the top of the joint band
28. shall be protected from penetration of backfill into the mortar either by allowing the mortar to
29. stiffen, or by capping with a stiff mortar mix, or by covering with a structurally protective
30. The band shall not be removed from the joint.
31. The mortar used at all joint shall consist of one-part Portland cement to no more than three parts
    clean sand mixed with water. Interior joint mortar shall be mixed with as little water as possible
32. so, the mortar will be very stiff but workable. Exterior joint mortar shall be mixed with water
33. until it has the consistency of thick cream. During periods of cold weather, the joint mortar shall
34. be adequately protected from freezing.
35. To avoid pipe displacement, bedding and backfill shall be placed and consolidated at essentially
    the same rate on both sides of the pipe.
