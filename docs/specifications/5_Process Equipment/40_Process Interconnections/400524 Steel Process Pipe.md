## Execution

1. Installation
   1. Install products in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Joining Methods - Flanges:
   1. Facing method:
      1. Insert slip-on flange on pipe.
      2. Assure maximum tolerances for flange faces from normal with respect to axis of pipe is 0.005 IN per foot of flange diameter.
      3. Test flanges after welding to pipe for true to face condition and reface, if necessary, to bring to specified tolerance.
   2. Joining method:
      1. Leave 1/8 to 3/8 IN of flange bolts projecting beyond face of nut after tightening.
      2. Coordinate dimensions and drillings of flanges with flanges for valves, pumps, equipment, tank, and other interconnecting piping systems.
      3. When bolting flange joints, exercise extreme care to assure that there is no restraint on opposite end of pipe or fitting which would prevent uniform gasket compression or cause unnecessary stress, bending or torsional strains being applied to cast flanges or flanged fittings.
         1. Allow one (1) flange free movement in any direction while bolts are being tightened.
      4. Do not assemble adjoining flexible coupled, mechanical coupled or welded joints until flanged joints in piping system have been tightened.
      5. Gradually tighten flange bolts uniformly to permit even gasket compression.
      6. Do not overstress bolts to compensate for poor installation.
3. Joining Method - Welded Joints:
   1. Perform welding in accordance with AWWA C206 and this Section.
   2. For flange attachment perform in accordance with AWWA C207.
   3. Have each welding operator affix an assigned symbol to all his welds.
      1. Mark each longitudinal joint at the extent of each operator's welding.
      2. Mark each circumferential joint, nozzle, or other weld into places 180 degrees apart.
   4. Welding for all process piping shall conform to ASME B31.3.
      1. Welding of utility piping 125 psi and less shall be welded per ASME B31.9.

   6. Weldolets may be used for 5 IN and larger pipe provided all slag is removed from inside the pipe.
   7. Weld-in nozzles may be used for branch connections to mains and where approved by Engineer.
   8. Use all long radius welding elbows for expansion loops and bends.
   9. Use long radius reducing welding elbows 90 degree bends and size changes are required.
4. Joining Method - Couplings:
   1. Compression sleeve:
      1. Install coupling to allow space of not less than 1/4 IN but not more than 1 IN.
      2. Provide harnessed joint.
         1. Use joint harness arrangements detailed in AWWA M11.
      3. Provide ends to be joined or fitted with compression sleeve couplings of the plain end type.
      4. Grind smooth welds the length of one (1) coupling on either side of joint to be fitted with any coupling.
      5. Assure that outside diameter and out-of-round tolerances are within limits required by coupling manufacturer.
   2. Mechanical coupling:
      1. Arrange piping so that pipe ends are in full contact.
      2. Groove and shoulder ends of piping in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
      3. Provide coupling and grooving technique assuring a connection which passes pressure testing requirements.
5. Joining Method - Threaded and Coupled (T/C):
   1. Provide T/C end conditions that meet ASME B1.2 requirements.
   2. Furnish pipe with factory-made T/C ends.
   3. Field cut additional threads full and clean with sharp dies.
   4. Leave not more than three (3) pipe threads exposed at each branch connection.
