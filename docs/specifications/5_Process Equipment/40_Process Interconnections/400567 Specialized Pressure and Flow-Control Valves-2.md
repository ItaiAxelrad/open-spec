04. SERVICE APPLICATION
   1. Reduced-pressure backflow prevention assemblies shall be provided on all commercial and industrial water services. Depending on degree of hazard, a double check valve assembly may be required in place of a reduced-pressure backflow assembly.
2. Reduced-pressure backflow prevention assemblies shall be provided on irrigation services where served by potable water.
3. Reduced-pressure backflow prevention assemblies shall be provided on potable water services where recycled water, well water or any other water supply is served to the same property.
4. Double check valve assemblies shall be provided at all points of connections to City sources at construction sites.
5. Reduced-pressure detector assemblies shall be provided on all fire services. Backflow prevention on fire services shall be as required by the City and per USC Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research.
6. The City shall be the final authority as to the location, installation, and type of backflow prevention device required.
05. GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
   1. The design and construction of backflow prevention assemblies shall meet the requirements called for in this specification except that any modifications specifically shown on the Approved Plans shall take precedence over these general standards.
2. The nominal size of the backflow prevention device shall be equal to or greater than the size of the purchased meter. For example, a 1" meter shall have a 1" or larger backflow device.
3. The assembly shall include same size valves located on either side of the backflow prevention assemblies. Four test cocks shall be appropriately located on the assembly for testing and certification.
4. The nominal size of reduced-pressure principle detector assemblies shall be as shown on the Approved Plans or as directed by the Fire Department of jurisdiction.
5. Enclosures and concrete slabs shall be provided only as shown on the Approved Plans or as required by the agency of jurisdiction.
06. DELIVERY, STORAGE AND HANDLING
   1. Backflow prevention assemblies shall be delivered and stored in accordance with AWWA C210, AWWA C213, and AWWA C550. The port openings shall be covered with plastic, cardboard, or wood while in transit and during storage in the field. These covers shall remain in place until the backflow assembly is ready to be installed. Backflow assemblies shall not be stored in contact with bare ground. Backflow assemblies shall not be stacked.
07. WARNING/IDENTIFICATION TAPE
   1. Warning/Identification tape shall be installed for backflow prevention assemblies in accordance with Section 15000.
1. PART 2 MATERIALS
1. 2.01 BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLIES
   1. Backflow prevention assemblies shall be among those listed on the list of “Approved Backflow Prevention Assemblies for Service Isolation" as issued by the State of California Department of Health Services, Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management.
1. 2.02 CONCRETE
   1. Concrete used for slabs and anchor or thrust blocks shall be in accordance with Section 03000.
1. 2.03 WARNING/IDENTIFICATION TAPE
   1. Warning/Identification Tape shall be in accordance with Section 15000 and the Approved Materials List.

## Execution

1. 3.01 INSTALLATION
   1. Installation shall comply with the latest edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code, applicable local agency and City requirements.
2. Backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed in accordance with the Standard Drawings.
3. Water service and fire service shut-off valves will be secured closed during installation until an approved backflow prevention device is installed and tested in compliance with this specification. 
4. When static pressure exceeds 150psi, when recommended by the backflow device manufacturer, or when required by the City Engineer, a pressure-reducing valve shall be installed as shown on the Standard Drawings.
1. 3.02 WARNING/IDENTIFICATION TAPE
   1. Warning/Identification tape shall be installed in accordance with Section 15000 and the Standard Drawings.
1. 3.03 CONCRETE
   1. Concrete thrust or anchor blocks and slabs shall be installed in accordance with Section 03000 and the Standard Drawings. Refer to Section 03000 for the minimum concrete curing time required.
1. 3.04 ENCLOSURES
   1. Enclosures shall be installed where shown on the Approved Plans or as directed by the Agency of jurisdiction in accordance with the Standard Drawings.
1. 3.05 DISINFECTION
   1. Disinfection and flushing shall be performed in accordance with Section 15041, as part of the process of disinfecting the main pipeline. The backflow assemblies shall be operated during the disinfection period to completely disinfect all internal parts.
