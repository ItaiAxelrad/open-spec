## Execution

1. Installation
   1. Joining Method â€“ Grooved End Joints:
   1. Install in accordance with ANSI/AWWA C606.
   1. Join two grooved pipe ends, or a pipe end and a valve.
   1. Position the gasket around the joint.
   1. Place the housing over the gasket and tighten with nuts and bolts to secure the housings together.
      1. The coupling housings shall encase the gasket and engage the grooves around the pipe to create a leak-tight seal.
2. Joining Method - Flanged Joints:
   1. Install in accordance with AWWA/ANSI C115/A21.15.
   2. Extend pipe completely through screwed-on flanged and machine flange face and pipe in single operation.
   3. Make flange faces flat and perpendicular to pipe centerline.
   4. When bolting flange joints, exercise extreme care to ensure that there is no restraint on opposite end of pipe or fitting which would prevent uniform gasket compression or would cause unnecessary stress, bending or torsional strains to be applied to cast flanges or flanged fittings.
   5. Allow one (1) flange free movement in any direction while bolts are being tightened.
   6. Do not assemble adjoining flexible joints until flanged joints in piping system have been tightened.
   7. Gradually tighten flange bolts uniformly to permit even gasket compression.
3. Flange Adaptors 12 IN and Less:
   1. Locate and drill holes for anchor studs after pipe is in place and bolted tight.
   2. Drill holes not more than 1/8 IN larger than diameter of stud projection.
4. Cutting:
   1. Repair interior lining material during cutting.
   2. Use abrasive wheel cutters or saws.
   3. Make square cuts.
   4. Bevel and free cut ends of sharp edges after cutting.
