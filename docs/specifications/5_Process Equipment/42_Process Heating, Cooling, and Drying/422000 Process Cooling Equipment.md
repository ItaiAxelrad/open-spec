   1. Where mechanically formed tee fittings are allowed, form mechanically extracted collars in a continuous operation, consisting of drilling a pilot hole and drawing out the tube surface to form a collar having a height of not less than three times the thickness of the tube wall. Use an adjustable collaring device. Notch and dimple the branch tube. Braze the joint, applying heat properly so that pipe and tee do not distort; remove distorted connections.

   1. Tunnel or remove sidewalk and curb in areas of excavation to the nearest joint. Remove pavements, curbs and gutters to neat and straight lines to the limits of removal. Make sawcut lines parallel to existing joints, or parallel or perpendicular to pavement edges to form a neat patch. Carefully remove remaining pavement within the saw cut area. Leave existing base materials between the area disturbed by the work and the saw cut line undisturbed by the saw cutting, pavement removal, or pavement replacement processes.

Rock excavation includes rock boulders of 1/2 cubic yard or more in volume.
   1. Rock excavation will be computed on the basis of the depth of rock removed and a trench width two (2) feet larger than the outside diameter of the pipe where one (1) pipe is laid in the trench and three (3) feet larger than the combined outside diameter where two (2) pipes are laid in the trench. Include 6" pipe and structure bedding in rock excavation. Include rock excavation shown on the plans in the Base Bid.
