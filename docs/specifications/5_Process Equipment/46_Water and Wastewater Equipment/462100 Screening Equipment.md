The Set Points screen in the graphical OI is described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System. Set points include–but are not limited to–analytical values, levels, timers, and flows.
			12. The software tagging convention for control devices is described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System and shall be followed explicitly by the Mechanical Screens, Conveyor, and Compactor equipment manufacturer in setting up and programming the PLC unless specifically approved in writing by the Systems Integrator and the Engineer.
			13. Special Alarms/Functions
				1. The PLC provided by the Mechanical Screens, Conveyor, and Compactor manufacturer shall continuously monitor the status of each piece of equipment and continuously compare that status to the current command for that equipment (either a PLC generated command or an operator command from the OI). If the equipment status does not agree with the PLC command (e.g. a pump commanded to run is not running or a valve commanded to close is not closed) the PLC shall generate a “Fault Logic Disagreement” alarm. This alarm shall be communicated to the OI.
				2. For gates or valves, the “Fault Logic Disagreement” alarm shall be delayed for 120 seconds after a change in status to allow valves to fully open or close. For pumps, the “Fault Logic Disagreement” alarm shall be delayed for 10 seconds after a change in status to allow pumps to start or stop.
				3. The PLC shall monitor GNRLFLT3 on the SCADA system and shall provide necessary output to a yellow strobe during conditions of a general fault via interposing relay.

   1. Functional Description
   1. The following is a general description of the equipment functions. Complete and detailed functions and logic are to be provided by the Mechanical Screens, Conveyor, and Compactor equipment manufacturer. All process set points shall be operator adjustable from the OI. The Mechanical Screens, Conveyor, and Compactor manufacturer shall provide initial factory settings of set points based on the specific conditions of this project or “typical” settings if specifics do not apply.

* 
	1. Operating Modes
   1. In this description, hardware functions, such as field hand switches, are referred to as “hard” (e.g. hard switch); software functions performed at the OI are referred to as “soft” (e.g. soft switch). Regardless of the mode of operation (described below) process indications will remain active (these may include valve position, motor on or off, VFD speed, process flow measurements, etc) and hard wired alarms and safeties (such as motor overloads or high temperature, etc) will be active and reported by the PLC.

* 
	+ 
		1. HAND OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the HAND position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall run and the system controls shall not control the device.
		2. LOCAL OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the LOCAL position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment is controlled locally by hard switches, which may include on-off, open-close, etc. and the system controls shall not control the equipment.
		3. OFF POSITION (Hard Switch): When the OFF position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall stop and the system controls shall not control the device.
		4. AUTO OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment shall be controlled automatically by the controls system.
		5. REMOTE OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the REMOTE position is selected at the hard switch the equipment will be controlled automatically by the controls system.
		6. AUTO OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the OI soft switch, the system automatic controls (logic) are enabled and the manual soft switches are disabled (these may include on-off, open close, etc).
		7. MANUAL OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the MANUAL position is selected at the OI soft switch, the manual soft controls are enabled (these may include on- off, open close, etc) and the system automatic controls (logic) are disabled
		8. EMERGENCY STOP (Hard Switch): Equipment can be deactivated at any time by pressing the EMERGENCY STOP push button (where present). The EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton overrides all other controls including remote or automatic controls and the hard HOA switch. EMERGENCY STOP pushbuttons shall be hardwired into the motor starting control circuitry, as shown on the schematics found in the Electrical drawings. For equipment where schematics have not been provided on the contract drawings, integration of hardwire EMERGENCY STOP control shall be included. EMERGENCY STOP push buttons must be manually reset to allow the equipment to run.
	1. AUTOMATIC OPERATION (Auto mode selected)
		1. FAULT CONDITIONS: Motor overload or high motor current shall stop the drive motor and illuminate the fault light. Manual reset is required to restart the unit.
		2. SCREENS. When the Auto mode is selected, a screen shall run when the water level rises high enough to actuate the associated float switch. The screen shall run continuously as long as the switch is actuated. After the water level has lowered and deactivated the level switch, the unit shall continue to run for the (adjustable) length of time set on the off delay timer.
		3. CONVEYOR: When the Auto mode is selected, the conveyor shall start when either screen starts and shall run intermittently per the settings of an adjustable repeat cycle timer. The conveyor shall continue to cycle as long as either screen is running.
		4. COMPACTOR
			1. The compactor motor starts an adjustable time after the conveyor starts. The compactor motor runs for an adjustable length of time.
			2. The compactor motor continues to run and the wash zone solenoid opens for an adjustable length of time. The compactor motor stops for an adjustable length of time, while the wash zone solenoid remains open.
			3. Motor stop/start cycle repeats for an adjustable number of counts
			4. The washing solenoid closes and the compactor motor runs for an adjustable length of time to dewater and discharge the screenings
			5. The flush solenoid opens for an adjustable length of time after the compactor motor stops. The system resets after the flush solenoid closes.
			6. The cycle shall repeat as long as either screen is running.
		5. INLET GATE CONTROL
			1. The Inlet Gates to the two mechanical screens and to the manual bar screen are controlled by the “Screenings Controller” (PLC).
			2. When the Remote mode is selected, the Inlet Gate automatically opens when the associated mechanical screen is selected to run or in “Hand” operation at the screen control panel.
			3. When the Remote mode is selected, the Inlet Gate automatically closes when the associated mechanical screen is not selected to run or in “Off” position at the screen control panel.
			4. The Mechanical Screens (and associated Inlet Gates) shall be operated on a lead-lag basis and alternated based upon Influent Flow Rate setpoint (operator selectable) in a FIFO (First In (On), First Out (Off)) approach. For influent flow rate up to 18 MGD (operator selectable), only one of the two screens shall operate (and associated inlet gate opens). When the flow exceeds 19 MGD (operator selectable), both screens shall operate. The alternator circuit shall be such that if one Mechanical Screen and / or the associated Inlet Gate is unavailable (not in Auto (Screen) or Remote (Inlet Gate)), then the alternator circuit shall be by-passed, allowing the available Mechanical Screen / Inlet Gate pair to become lead. The lead-lag sequence of the two screens shall be operator selectable.
			5. The Inlet Gate to the Manual Bar Screen is normally closed and is automatically opened by the Screenings Controller upon High Level in the Screens Influent Channel. The gate is closed automatically by the Screenings Controller when the level in the influent channel reaches the

“Close Manual Bar Screen Gate” level. These level set points are operator- adjustable.

		1. ADJUSTABLE TIMERS
			1. Adjustable timers are PLC functions and will be preset by the manufacturer to typical values.
	1. SOURCE QUALITY CONTROL
		1. Following factory assembly, the screens, conveyor, and press shall be tested for a minimum of eight hours prior to shipment to verify proper operation. Adjust equipment to achieve acceptable clearances, vibrations, and tracking.
   1. Execution

* 
	1. INSTALLATION
		1. Channel depth varies because the building floor slopes to the edge of the channels. Coordinate installation of support legs with concrete work. Install legs on grout pads of adequate thickness to meet the 7.5-foot nominal depth of channels; shim legs for a plumb installation prior to grouting. Install screens in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.
	2. PAINTING AND CLEANING
		1. Finish paint items that are factory-primed, after installations.
	3. TESTING
		1. The screens and conveyor shall be operated for two (2) hours and the washer compactor shall be operated for thirty (30) minutes to ensure that all clearances, vibrations, tracking and motor operating characteristics are within acceptable limits. Test control functions of control panel to verify operation in accordance with the specified control sequence.
	4. START-UP SERVICES
		1. The equipment manufacturer shall provide the services of a field representative for a total of two (2) trips of two (2) working days each for a total of four (4) days, for start-up inspection and for instructing and assisting the Contractor and the Owner’s personnel in the start-up and proper operation of the equipment.
