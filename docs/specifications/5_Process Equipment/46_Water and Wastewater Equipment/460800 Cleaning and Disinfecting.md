10. At completion of work and prior to Final Acceptance, thoroughly clean work installed under these Specifications.
	1. Clean equipment, fixtures, pipe, valves, and fittings of grease, metal cuttings, and sludge which may have accumulated by operation of system, from testing, or from other causes.
	2. Repair any stoppage or discoloration or other damage to parts of building, its finish, or furnishings, due to failure to properly clean piping system, without cost to Owner.
	3. Disinfection of Pipes and Pipelines
11. After favorable performance of pressure test and prior to Final Acceptance, thoroughly flush entire potable water piping system including supply, source and any appurtenant devices and perform disinfection as prescribed.
12. Perform work, including preventative measures during construction, in full compliance with AWWA C651.
13. Perform disinfection using sodium hypochlorite complying with AWWA B300.
14. Flush each segment of system to provide flushing velocity of not less than 3.0 FT per second.
	1. Where such flow rates are not possible, flushing at the maximum expected flow rate for the line for 2-3 volumes may be acceptable.
15. Drain flushing water to sanitary sewer.
16. Use continuous feed method of application.
	1. This method consists of completely filling the main with potable water, removing air pockets, then flushing the completed main to remove particulates, and refilling the main with potable water that has been chlorinated with 25 mg/L. 
	2. After a 24-hour holding period in the main there shall be a free chlorine residual of not less than 10 mg/L. 
	3. Tag system during disinfection procedure to prevent use.
	4. After required contact period, flush system to remove traces of heavily chlorinated water.
17. Procedure for chlorinating:
	1. Potable water may be supplied from a temporary backflow-protected connection to the existing distribution system or other supply. 
	2. At a point not more than 10 ft. downstream from the beginning of the new system, water entering the new system shall receive a dose of chlorine fed at a constant rate such that the water will not have less than 25 mg/L free chlorine. 
		1. Chlorine shall be measured at regular time intervals in accordance with AWWA Manual M12.
	3. Table 1 provides the chlorine required to produce an initial 25-mg/L concentration in 10 ft. of pipe by diameter.
	4. The chlorinated water shall be retained in the main for at least 24 hour, during which time valves shall be operated to ensure disinfection of the appurtenance. 
	5. At the end of the 24-hr period, the treated water shall have a residual of not less than 10 mg/L of free chlorine. 
	6. Direct-fee chlorinators which operate solely from gas pressure in a chlorine cylinder shall not be used for the application of liquid chlorine.
		1. Preferred equipment for applying liquid chlorine is a solution-feed vacuum-operated chlorinator and a booster pump.
18. After final flushing and before placing water in service, obtain an independent laboratory approved by the Owner to collect samples and test for bacteriological quality.
	1. Repeat entire disinfection procedures until satisfactory results are obtained.

      1. Minimum free chlorine concentration of 200 mg/L. 
2. Procedure:
	1. In accordance with AWWA C653. 
	2. Inject the disinfecting solution into the pump and associated pumping and circulate for a minimum of 2 hours. 
		1. At the end of the 2 hour period, the solution shall have a strength of at least 100 mg/L free chlorine.
	3. Operate valves and or pump appurtenances during disinfection to ensure that the disinfecting solution is dispersed into all parts of the pumps and lines. 
	4. If the disinfecting solution contained in the pumps has a residual free chlorine concentration of less than 100 mg/L after the 2 hour retention period, reclean the pump, reapply disinfecting solution, and retest until satisfactory result is achieved. 
	5. After chlorination, flush the water from the pumps until the water through the units is chemically and bacteriologically equal to the permanent source of supply. 
	6. Where circulating the disinfection solution is not practical, spray chlorine or pump interior, rinse thoroughly with water.
