4. DUAL SURFACE DENSITY CURRENT BAFFLE
5. General
6. The Dual Surface Dual Surface Density Current Baffle is designed to improve the performance of the clarifier by intercepting the density currents formed within the clarifier and diverting the flow back into the main clarification volume of the tank. The manufacturer shall coordinate the baffle design and installation requirements with the clarifier mechanism, scum box and launder channel configurations. 2. Materials: 1. Each baffle panel shall be molded of fiberglass-reinforced plastic. The resins and fiberglass reinforcing material shall be consistent with the environmental conditions and structural requirements. 2. The resin shall be an isophthalic polyester resin with corrosion-resistant properties, Corezyn COR75-AQ-010 resin or equivalent, suitable for use in submerged waste treatment applications. The resin shall not contain fillers except as required for viscosity control. For viscosity control, a thixotropic agent up to 5% by weight may be added to the resin. The resin shall be treated to provide ultraviolet suppression. 3. Glass reinforcement shall consist of chemically bonded surfacing mat and chopped strand roving. Surfacing mat shall be Type C veil. The glass reinforcement shall be 357-211 PLN CTC chopped strand roving or equivalent. The glass content of the finished laminate shall not be less than 30% by weight. The nominal thickness of each baffle panel shall be 1/4-inch × 1/16-inch thick with resin rich surfaces and edges to prevent migration of moisture and fiber “blooming”. The baffle shall be black in color. 4. The upper surface of each panel shall be mold smooth and no glass fibers shall be exposed. Laminations shall be dense and free of voids, dry spots, cracks or crazes. The upper surface of the baffle shall be reinforced with one layer of surfacing veil followed by 2 ounces or more of chopped strand roving. In addition, each mounting and stiffening flange shall be reinforced with one layer of 24 oz woven roving. No other glass product is permitted between these layers. All factory-trimmed edges shall be “hot coated” with resin to prevent wicking. 5. All installation fasteners and anchors shall be Type 316 stainless steel. 3. Each panel shall have the following minimum physical properties: 1. Test

   1. The Dual Surface Density Current Baffle System shall consist of a series of asymmetric baffle modules that fasten to the wall of the clarifier and form a compound baffle surface around the entire inner periphery of the tank. Each module will consist of 1) an upper baffle section that attaches to the tank wall and extends inward and down at a predefined inclination angle and
      1. a lower baffle section that attaches to the tank wall and extends inward and upward to meet the upper section. The width, inclination angles of the individual baffle surfaces and mounting location of the baffle shall be determined based upon the clarifier configuration and typical operating conditions. The modules shall be a maximum of 8 feet in length and shall be curved to follow the curvature of the clarifier tank. The modules shall be designed such that adjacent sections fit together properly and the completed baffle has a well-engineered and professional appearance.
   2. Each module shall be molded of corrosion-resistant, UV-treated fiberglass. The upper and lower sections of the baffle may be integrally molded as one piece, or they may be supplied as two pieces that are fastened together during baffle installation. In either case, provision shall be made to attach the upper section to the tank wall and support it at the proper angle using a triangular shaped bracket. The upper panel and bracket shall be molded as an integral unit. Only one bracket is required per upper baffle section. A specially formed “free-end” bracket shall be provided to support the free end of the last panel where the run of panels is interrupted by an obstruction. Panels may be cut as required to fit around obstructions. Baffle systems without triangular baffle supports are unacceptable.
   3. The lower baffle section shall be supplied integral to the upper section, or it may be formed as a separate section. In either case, provision shall be made to fasten the lower baffle section to the tank wall with integrally molded mounting brackets. These brackets shall be designed to hold the lower baffle section away from the wall to provide a means of venting the compound baffle structure.
   4. If the lower baffle section is supplied as a separate unit, provision shall be made to fasten the upper and lower sections together by means of the horizontal stiffening flanges on both the upper and lower sections. Further, the design shall enable the lower section to be retrofitted to existing Stamford Density Current Baffle Systems that may already be installed.
   5. A method of interconnecting adjacent panels shall be provided such that the entire assembly forms a rigid structure capable of supporting its own weight plus snow and wind loads in the event the tank is out of service. The baffle shall also be designed to withstand a buoyant force load equal to the weight of the water displaced from the volume beneath the baffle. The angled working surface of each baffle shall be sufficient in pitch and width to divert the flow and to create a self-cleaning action of the baffle itself. Provision shall also be made to vent gases that may form beneath the baffle through 2-inch radius half round openings molded into the upper panel section at its highest point.

## Execution

1. INSTALLATION

   1. Weirs and Scum Baffles
      1. The contractor shall field verify existing dimensions and install the weir and scum baffle in accordance with the Contract Drawings, approved shop drawings and manufacturer’s recommendations. Field cutting of panels will be allowed to complete the structure. All field cut or drilled edges shall be sealed per the manufacturer’s recommendations. All the fasteners and anchors required for installation shall be supplied by the weir and scum baffle manufacturer.
      2. Weirs and scum baffles shall be carefully aligned and leveled to the elevations shown on the drawings. In the completed installation, no variation greater than 1/8-inch shall exist between any two notches of the weir plate in any one tank. In addition, the average deviation from one quadrant of the weir to any other shall not exceed 1/16 inch. The installation contractor shall apply a suitable sealant between all the weir plates and the walls to prevent the flow of liquid between the weir and the tank wall.
   2. Dual Surface Density Current Baffles
      1. The contractor shall field verify existing dimensions and install the baffle in accordance with the contract drawings approved shop drawings and manufacturer’s recommendations. Mounting holes shall be factory drilled. Field cutting of baffle panels will be allowed to complete the structure and accommodate in-tank obstructions. All field cut or drilled edges shall be coated per the manufacturer’s recommendations to prevent fiber blooming or fraying. All of the fasteners required for installation shall be supplied by the baffle manufacturer.
   3. The baffle panels shall be attached to the wall using 3/8" x 3-3/4" concrete expansion anchors with oversized 1/8" x 2-1/4" stainless steel washers, and hex nuts. Adjacent baffle panels are fastened together using 1/4-inch bolts, 2 flat washers, lock washer and hex nut. All the installation fasteners and anchors shall be Type 316 stainless steel.

      1. The Dual Surface Density Current Baffle shall extend completely around the tank and shall be level, rigid and free of sway that could work anchors loose or cause undue wear.
