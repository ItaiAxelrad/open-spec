Lower test load at slow speed and with the controller in the slow lowering position disconnect the main power source and return the controller to the neutral position. The test load should stop lowering when the controller is placed in the neutral position.
15. Trolley Motion: 
	12. Push trolley with test load (if space is available) the full distance of the bridge rails using extreme caution and observe any binding of bridge trucks and for proper operation.
