   1. Product

* 
	1. ACCEPTABLE MANUFACTURERS
		1. Subject to compliance with requirements of these specifications and plans, manufacturers offering pumps which may be supplied for the work include the following:
			1. Moyno, Inc.
			2. Approved equal.
	2. PUMPS
		1. Pump Requirements
   1. Liquid Pumped Primary Municipal Sludge Solids Concentration 4% - 5.0%
   1. Specific gravity 1.05
   1. Capacity, Each Pump 105 gpm Maximum TDH 70 psi
   1. Minimum Horsepower 15 HP (see paragraph 1 below)
   1. Pump Size 6" x 6"
   1. Pump Speed 250 rpm maximum

* 
	+ 
		- 
			1. Higher HP motor than what is required for normal operating and starting torques is needed because of the higher pressure setting of the automatic pressure sensor in the common discharge line.
			2. Pumps shall be heavy duty, positive displacement, and progressing cavity type capable of continuous operation handling abrasive particles. The pump shall be cradle-mounted to permit the suction port to be rotated to any angle perpendicular to the centerline of the pump. Suction and discharge connections shall be 125-pound ANSI cast iron flanged.
		1. Housing Components
			1. Suction and discharge housings are to have smooth flow characteristics and be manufactured from GG25 cast iron.
			2. The housings shall be drilled and tapped NPT connections that can be used for the installation of pressure gauges/switches or for a drain.
		2. Rotating Components
			1. The pump rotor shall be machined of AISI 4150 alloy steel, hardened to a Rockwell “C” value of 57 to 60 and covered with a heavy layer of hard chrome plate at least 0.010-inch thick for abrasion resistance.
			2. The rotor shall be joined to the drive shaft by a 316 stainless steel connecting rod and crowned-gear type, oil-lubricated or grease-lubricated, sealed universal joints of chrome alloy tool steel of adequate design to transmit the required thrust and torque while allowing the rotor to move through is eccentric path.
			3. The joint seals shall be clamped at both outside and inside diameters and recessed within heavy-walled steel tubing to prevent damage by rags or other objects. To maximize universal joint and seal life, the connecting rod operating angle shall not exceed 1-1/4 degrees off center.
			4. The drive shaft shall be solid. If hollow drive shaft is used, then a fiber deflector shall be installed to prevent the solids from entering the hollow shaft.
		3. Stator
			1. The rotor shall rotate relative to a one-piece, medium-high Buna “N” rubber stator of approximate 65(±5) Durometer hardness (Shore A) securely bonded to its steel tube housing.
			2. The stator shall be chamfered on the ends to increase the chamber filling efficiency.
			3. The stator shall have integral molded gaskets to prevent the pumped material from contacting the bonding of the tube.
		4. Shaft seal
			1. The stuffing box shall be equipped with a single-acting mechanical seal as manufactured by Burgmann or equal. Seal is to operate independently of the direction of rotation and to be of the rubber bellows design.
			2. Although the seals are not be flushed, seal housing shall have flushing connections for future use.
			3. The metal parts to be stainless steel and the seal faces are to be silicon carbide.
		5. Drive and Baseplate
			1. Motor shall be horizontal totally enclosed fan, 15 HP, 3 phase, 60 cycle, 460 Volt, 1200 RPM, and shall be connected to the pump by the drive method specified. All motors shall be a nationally known manufacture and shall conform to NEMA standards and specifications.
			2. The motor shall be piggy-back mounted with pulleys and belt and belt guard. The pump and motor assembly shall be mounted on a structural steel baseplate.
		6. Finishes - All surfaces shall be prepared and shop painted with the manufacturer’s standard system unless otherwise noted.
		7. Testing
			1. The complete pumping unit shall be tested at the manufacturer’s facility to ensure that it will meet the design conditions listed in the Pump Requirements. Tests done on the pump only will not be acceptable and will be cause for rejecting.
		8. Accessories
			1. Anchor Bolts: Anchor bolts shall be as recommended by the manufacturer and shall be of stainless steel. Pipe sleeves for anchor bolts shall be twice the bolt diameter.
			2. Name Plates: Each pump shall have a stainless steel nameplate showing manufacturer’s name and model number, capacity in gpm, head in feet and rpm at the low and high end of pump duty for pump protection
   1. Execution

* 
	1. INSPECTION
		1. Examine all equipment at the site to determine that it is in conformance with the approved shop drawings, and that it is new, in good condition, and capable of the required performance.
		2. Examine the installation site, as applicable, to determine its suitability and conformance to specifications for the equipment installation.
	2. INSTALLATION
		1. Install the pumps in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
	3. EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER’S SERVICES
		1. Provide the services of a qualified representative of the manufacturer to assist in adjusting and testing of all equipment furnished, and to ensure that the pumping equipment is properly installed for satisfactory operation throughout the specified range.
