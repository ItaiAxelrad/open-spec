## General

:
		1. Brass or stainless-steel nameplates identifying the name of the manufacturer, voltage, phase, rated horsepower, speed and any other pertinent data shall be attached to each pump.
	2. Anchors and Fasteners: 
		1. All necessary foundation bolts, plates, nuts, and washers shall be furnished by the equipment manufacturer and shall be Type 316 stainless steel.
	3. Pump Design: 
		1. The pumps shall be capable of handling raw unscreened domestic wastewater and passing a minimum 3-inch diameter solid sphere.
	4. Casing: 
		1. The stator casing and oil casing shall be of gray cast iron construction, with all parts coming into contact with sewage protected by a corrosion resistant paint proven to withstand an environment of raw wastewater.
	5. Impeller: 
		1. The impeller shall be constructed of gray cast iron, ASTM A-48, class 30 – 40. All external bolts and nuts shall be Type 316 stainless steel. Each pump shall be provided with a replaceable metallic wear ring system to maintain pump efficiency. Impellers can be of the closed or open type. The closed type can utilize a single or double vane. The open type shall be single or double vane with a self-cleaning, adjustable cast iron wear plate. All impellers shall be dynamically balanced and of non-clog design capable of passing solids, fibrous material, and heavy sludge and constructed with long throughways with no acute turns.
	6. Mechanical Seals: 
		1. Each pump shall be provided with a tandem double mechanical seal running in an oil or air reservoir, composed of two separate lapped face seals, each consisting of one stationary and one rotating tungsten carbide or silicone ring with each pair held in contact by a separate spring, so that the outside pressure assists spring compression in preventing the seal faces from opening. The compression spring shall be protected against exposure to the pumped liquid. Silicon carbide may be used in place of tungsten carbide for the upper and lower seal. The pumped liquid shall be sealed from the oil or air reservoir by one face seal and the oil reservoir from the air-filled motor chamber by the other. The seals shall require neither maintenance nor adjustment and shall be easily replaced. Seal shall be held in place by locking ring. Conventional double mechanical seals are not acceptable. Cartridge seals are acceptable.
	7. Guide Rails, Lifting Cable, and Discharge Elbow
	8. The design shall be such that pumping units will be automatically connected to the discharge piping when lowered into place on the discharge connection. Pump removal for service or inspection will be by quick disconnect and hoist retrieve. Removal shall not require personnel to enter the wet well nor shall nuts, bolts or fasteners require removal. Each pump shall be fitted with 6-feet of Type 316 stainless steel, minimum Grade 50, 3/4-inch chain attached to the lifting mechanism and air craft rated 1/4-inch stainless steel cable provided between the cable holder and the chain ("Grip-eye System", or acceptable equal), to permit raising the pump for inspection and removal using a closed chain hook and electric hoist. The lifting bail shall be constructed of Type 316 stainless steel for each pump.
	9. A sliding guide bracket shall be an integral part of the pumping unit and the pump casing shall have a machined connecting flange to connect with the cast iron discharge connection, which shall be bolted to the floor of the wet well with stainless steel anchor bolts and so designed as to receive the pump discharge flange without the need of any bolts or nuts.
	10. Sealing of the pumping unit to the discharge connection shall be accomplished by a simple downward motion with the entire weight of the pumping unit guided by two Schedule 40 welded seamless Type 316 stainless steel guide bars which will press it tightly against the discharge connection. All Type 316 seamless tubular stainless-steel guides shall be 2-inch diameter for use with pumps up to 25-horsepower. Pumps greater than 25-horsepower shall use 3-inch diameter Type 316 seamless tubular stainless-steel guides. No portion of the pump shall bear directly on the floor of the wet well and no rotary motion of the pump shall be required for sealing. Sealing at the discharge connection shall be metal-to-metal contact of the pump discharge and mating discharge connection.
	11. The pump base elbow design shall be interchangeable such that it will provide a watertight connection for any of the specified or otherwise accepted pumps without requiring any special tools, gaskets or adapters. Assembly shall be capable of receiving a standard Flygt pump without special modification to either the pump or existing base elbow.
	12. Approved pump manufacturers, if necessary, to meet the above specification, shall provide a sliding guide bracket adapter.
	13. Pump base elbow shall be bolted to a 1-inch-thick steel pump base plate which is anchored to the wet well floor at six locations with 6-inch epoxy anchors. Pump base plate shall extend 6-inches beyond the pump volute and base elbow and trimmed to fit as necessary.
	14. Pump Motor: 
		1. All motors shall be built in accordance with the latest NEMA, IEEE, ANSI and AFBMA Standards where applicable. The pump motor shall be housed in an air-filled watertight casing and shall have Class H insulated windings which shall be moisture resistant. The motors shall be NEMA Design B rated 155°C maximum. Pump motors shall have cooling characteristics suitable to permit continuous operation in a totally, partially or non-submerged condition. The pump shall be capable of running continuously in a totally dry non-submerged condition under full load without damage for extended periods. Before final acceptance a field running test demonstrating this ability, with 24-hours of continuous operation under the above conditions, shall be performed for all pumps being supplied as required by the County. The motor shall be capable of a minimum of 10 starts per hour. Motors 25-horsepower and below shall be rated 230/460-volt, 3-phase and speed shall be nominal 1,750 RPM or less. Motors greater than 25-horsepower shall be 460 volt, 3-phase and speed shall be nominal 1,750 RPM or less. Pump motors shall be non-overloading over the entire published performance curve.
	15. Heat and Moisture Sensors: 
		1. Each motor shall incorporate a minimum of one ambient temperature compensated overheat sensing device. This protective device shall be wired into the pump controls in such a way that if excessive temperature is detected the pump will shut down. This device shall be self-resetting.
	16. Cables: 
		1. Cables shall be designed specifically for submersible pump applications and shall be properly sealed. A type CGB watertight connector with a neoprene gland shall be furnished with each pump to seal the cable entry at the control panel. The pump cable entry seal design shall preclude specific torque requirements to insure a watertight and submersible seal. The cable entry shall be comprised of a single cylindrical elastomer grommet, flanked by washers, all having a close tolerance fit against the cable outside diameter and the entry inside diameter and compressed by the entry body containing a strain relief function, separate from the function of sealing the cable. The assembly shall bear against a shoulder in the pump top. The cable entry junction chamber and motor shall be separated by a stator lead sealing gland or terminal board, which shall isolate the motor interior from foreign material gaining access through the pump top. Secondary sealing systems utilizing epoxy potting compounds may be used. The manufacturers shall supply a cable cap as part of the spare parts for each pump when this type of sealing system is used. All cables shall be continuous, without splices from the motor to the control panel, unless otherwise approved by the County. The junction chamber containing the terminal board shall be perfectly leak proof.
