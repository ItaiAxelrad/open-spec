    1. Design
       1. The basic design shall be a single-passage, clog-free pump, utilizing a screw-centrifugal impeller. The overall pump design shall combine high efficiency, low required NPSH, a large solid passage, and the ability to handle rags or other fibrous material without plugging.
       2. The hydraulic design of the impeller shall combine the action of a positive displacement screw with the action of a single-vane centrifugal impeller to provide a single, non- bifurcated flowstream with only gradual changes in flow direction.
       3. The leading edge of the impeller vane shall blend into the impeller body in such a way that any rag or other fibrous material caught on the leading edge and folded over both sides of the vane will be unfolded and released as the textile follows the flowstream through the pump.
       4. The impeller flange or impeller shall contain a spiral groove on the rear face so the any solids in the pumped media are discharged from the space between the backplate and the rear of the impeller.
       5. In order to maintain optimum running clearances along the entire length of the impeller to maintain design hydraulic efficiencies, the geometry of the impeller and suction piece shall be conical, so any axial adjustment of the impeller will cause the clearance between the impeller and suction piece to change uniformly along the entire length of the impeller.
       6. Designs incorporating curved, or combination curved/conical impeller and suction piece are not acceptable because in such design clearances cannot be adjusted uniformly over the full length of the impeller.
       7. Suction and discharge flanges shall be drilled to meet ANSI 125 lb bolting.
    2. Abrasion-Resistant Construction
       1. The pump volute, backplate and suction piece housing shall be of close-grained cast iron, ASTM A 48-CL30.
       2. The impeller shall be of 450 Brinell hardness hi-chrome iron, ASTM A 532 Class III Type A1.
       3. The suction shall have an independently replaceable suction liner of minimum 450 Brinell hi-chrome Iron, ASTM A 532 Class III Type A1 and shall be externally adjustable by means of three stainless steel regulating screws (except D3K and D4K, which shall be adjustable by shims). Each adjusting screw shall incorporate a mechanism for positively advancing, positively retracting, and positively locking the position of the suction liner, so that the necessary running clearances between the liner and impeller can be maintained without disassembly of the pump and/or piping.
    3. Bearing Housing
       1. The bearing housing shall be of cast iron, ASTM A 48-CL-30 and shall be of the back pull out design so that the bearing housing and impeller can be removed without disconnecting the casing from the suction and discharge piping.
       2. The shaft shall be steel and provided with suitable bearings capable of taking all mechanical and hydraulic loads. Unless otherwise specified, bearings shall provide a minimum B10 bearing life of 50,000 hours without credit for hydraulic balancing by pump-out vanes, grooves, or wear rings.
       3. The stuffing box shall be isolated from contaminants in the pumped media by a labyrinth fit between the impeller backside and the volute backplate, as well as by pump-out grooves machined into the impeller back shroud and into the volute backplate, to prevent debris from reaching the shaft seal.
    4. Shaft Sealing
       1. Tandem Mechanical Seal Arrangement Requiring No External Flush. Shaft sealing shall be by independently-mounted, tandem mechanical seals contained in an oil chamber that is formed as an intrinsic part of the bearing frame and allows the seals to be completely submerged in and lubricated by the oil bath. Externally-mounted oil reservoirs are not acceptable. Seals requiring a water flush are not acceptable.
       1. The mechanical seal nearest the bearing shall utilize carbon/ceramic faces, and shall isolate the seal cooling oil from the bearing frame. When mounted in a vertical configuration, this shall allow the pump to operate continuously submerged within 4 inches of the upper bearing cap.
       1. The mechanical seal nearest the impeller shall be a stainless steel or rubber bellow- type construction firmly attached to the rotating face and clamped to the shaft, to prevent contaminants from contacting the stainless-steel spring which loads the seal face. The seal faces shall be a solid tungsten-carbide rotating face running against a solid silicon-carbide stationary face. Seals with both faces of similar materials, or seals with bonded, soldered, or converted face surfaces are not equal or acceptable.
       1. The mechanical seal nearest the impeller shall be contained in a seal chamber formed by the impeller flange and a recess cast into the motor frame. To prevent debris from entering the chamber and to prolong the mechanical seal life, a flush port shall be provided so that an optional external water flush can be supplied directly into the seal chamber.
       1. The mechanical seal nearest the impeller shall be isolated from contaminants in the pumped media by a labyrinth-fit between the backside of the impeller and the

1.  backplate, as well as by pump-out grooves cast into the impeller back shroud and into the backplate, to minimize debris reaching the shaft seal.

    1. “Back-to-back” mounted double mechanical seals are not acceptable unless the contractor provides an approved seal pressurization system that guarantees the oil between the seals is always pressurized to at least 1-1/2 times the maximum shut- off head of the pump.
    1. Motor
       1. RAS Pumps: Motor shall be vertical, inverter duty type, 20 HP, 3 phase, 60 cycle, 460 Volt, 1150 RPM, and shall be connected to the pump by the drive method specified. All motors shall be of nationally known manufacture and shall conform to NEMA standards and specifications.
       2. WAS Pumps: Motor shall be vertical, TEFC, 5 HP, 3 phase, 60 cycle, 460 Volt, 1150 RPM, and shall be connected to the pump by the drive method specified. All motors shall be of nationally known manufacture and shall conform to NEMA standards and specifications.
    1. Accessories
       1. Anchor Bolts: Anchor bolts shall be as recommended by the manufacturer and should be of stainless steel. Pipe sleeves for anchor bolts shall be twice the bolt diameter.
       2. Name Plates: Each pump shall have a stainless steel nameplate showing manufacturer's name and model number, capacity in gpm, head in feet and rpm at the low and high end of pump duty.
    1. Performance Testing:
       1. A certified shop test shall be performed on each pumping unit in accordance with the test code of the Hydraulic Institute protocol “A”. Tests shall be sufficient to determine the curves of head, input horsepower, and efficiency for capacity from shutoff to 150% of design flow. A minimum of six points, including shutoff, shall be taken for each test run. At least one point of the six shall be taken as near as possible to each specified condition.
       2. Results of the performance tests shall be certified by a Professional Engineer and submitted for approval before final shipment.
