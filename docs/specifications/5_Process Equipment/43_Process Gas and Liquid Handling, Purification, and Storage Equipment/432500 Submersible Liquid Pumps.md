The minimum L10 bearing life shall be 50,000 hours at any usable portion of the pump curve.
1.  MECHANICAL SEAL
    1. Each pump shall be provided with a tandem mechanical shaft seal system consisting of two totally independent seal assemblies. The seals shall operate in an oil reservoir that hydrodynamically lubricates the lapped seal faces at a constant rate. The lower, primary seal unit, located between the pump and the oil chamber, shall contain one stationary and one positively driven rotating tungsten-carbide ring. The upper, secondary seal unit, located between the oil chamber and the motor housing, shall contain one stationary tungsten-carbide seal ring and one positively driven rotating carbon seal ring. Each seal interface shall be held in contact by its own spring system. The seals shall require neither maintenance nor adjustment nor depend on direction of rotation for sealing.
    2. The following seal types will not be considered acceptable nor equal to the dual independent seal specified: shaft seals without positively driven rotating members, or conventional double mechanical seals containing either a common single or double spring acting between the upper and lower seal faces. No system requiring a pressure differential to offset pressure and to affect sealing shall be used.
    3. Each pump shall be provided with an oil chamber for the shaft sealing system. The oil chamber shall be designed to prevent overfilling and to provide oil expansion capacity. The drain and inspection plug, with positive anti-leak seal shall be easily accessible from the outside. The seal system shall not rely upon the pumped media for lubrication. The motor shall be able to operate dry without damage while pumping under load.
    4. The area about the exterior of the lower mechanical seal in the cast iron housing shall have cast in an integral concentric spiral groove. This groove shall protect the seals by causing abrasive particulate entering the seal cavity to be forced out away from the seal due to centrifugal action.
    5. A separate seal leakage chamber shall be provided so that any leakage that may occur past the upper, secondary mechanical seal will be captured prior to entry into the motor stator housing. Such seal leakage shall not contaminate the motor lower bearing. The leakage chamber shall be equipped with a float-type switch that will signal if the chamber should reach 50% capacity.
1.  PUMP SHAFT
    1. Pump and motor shaft shall be the same unit. The pump shaft shall be an extension of the motor shaft. Use of couplings will not be acceptable. The shaft shall be stainless steel.

    1. Functional Description

1.  The following is a general description of the equipment functions. Complete and detailed functions and logic are to be provided by the Sump Pumps equipment manufacturer.

        1. Operating Modes

1.  In this description, hardware functions, such as field hand switches, are referred to as “hard” (e.g. hard switch); software functions performed at the OI are referred to as “soft” (e.g. soft switch). Regardless of the mode of operation (described below) process indications will remain active (these may include valve position, motor on or off, VFD speed, process flow measurements, etc) and hard wired alarms and safeties (such as motor overloads or high temperature, etc) will be active and reported by the PLC.

    1. HAND OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the HAND position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall run and the system controls shall not control the device. 2. LOCAL OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the LOCAL position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment is controlled locally by hard switches, which may include on-off, open-close, etc. and the system controls shall not control the equipment. 3. OFF POSITION (Hard Switch): When the OFF position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall stop and the system controls shall not control the device. 4. AUTO OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment shall be controlled automatically by the controls system. 5. REMOTE OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the REMOTE position is selected at the hard switch the equipment will be controlled automatically by the controls system. 6. AUTO OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the OI soft switch, the system automatic controls (logic) are enabled and the manual soft switches are disabled (these may include on-off, open close, etc). 7. MANUAL OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the MANUAL position is selected at the OI soft switch, the manual soft controls are enabled (these may include on- off, open close, etc) and the system automatic controls (logic) are disabled 8. EMERGENCY STOP (Hard Switch): Equipment can be deactivated at any time by pressing the EMERGENCY STOP push button (where present). The EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton overrides all other controls including remote or automatic controls and the hard HOA switch. EMERGENCY STOP pushbuttons shall be hardwired into the motor starting control circuitry, as shown on the schematics found in the Electrical drawings. For equipment where schematics have not been provided on the contract drawings, integration of hardwire EMERGENCY STOP control shall be included. EMERGENCY STOP push buttons must be manually reset to allow the equipment to run.
       1. AUTOMATIC OPERATION (AUTO or REMOTE mode selected)
       1. The controls shall operate the pumps in a lead-lag operation (the lead pump switching to the lag pump after the “all pumps stop” (low-low) action.
       1. LOW-LOW: On falling level, this stops all pumps. It has no affect on rising level.
       1. LOW: On rising level, this starts the LEAD pump. There is no affect on falling level.
       1. HIGH: On rising level, this starts the LAG pump while maintaining the LEAD pump running. There is no affect on falling level.
       1. HIGH-HIGH: On rising level, this activates the HIGH-HIGH alarm. On falling level, this clears the HIGH-HIGH alarm.
