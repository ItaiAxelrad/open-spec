        1. The pumps shall be of heavy duty construction, capable of continuous operation handling abrasive particles. The pumps shall be of a fully recessed impeller design, with the impeller mounted completely out of the flow path between pump inlet and outlet connections. The pumps shall be capable of passing grit slurry settled from raw sewage without clogging.

    1. Design
       1. Since these pumps will be used to pump abrasive grit and other solids, the pumps shall be specifically designed to both optimize wear resistance and then maintain hydraulic performance as wear occurs.
       2. The pumps shall be of a fully recessed, Slurry Type design, with the impeller mounted completely out of the flow path between the pump inlet and discharge connection, so that solids are not required to flow through the impeller. All flow path clearances within the pumps shall be equal to or greater than the discharge diameter, so that al solids which will pass through the discharge will pass through the pump.
       3. The impeller shall be constructed of 700 Brinell Hi Chrome and specifically designed to maintain hydraulic pumping performance as wear occurs.
       4. The impeller shall be of cup design such that the deepest portion of the vane is not located at the vane tips and the tips are surrounded by a thick-sectioned rim of minimum 1-1/8 inches thick at wear area. Minimum vane thickness at wet area shall be 7/8 inch and impeller Ni-Hard weight shall be minimum 60 lb.
       5. The hydraulic design shall be such that the length of the impeller vane increases as wear occurs to the rim, allowing as-new or better pumping performance throughout the wear cycle of the impeller.
       6. The hydraulic design of the impeller shall preferentially direct flow to a sacrificial, independently replaceable suction piece. The suction piece shall be easily accessible and replaceable, without the need to disassemble any other component of the pump.
       7. Pump-out vanes on the rear shroud of the impeller are not acceptable. Impellers of the radial design that incorporate the impeller in a recessed portion of the volute or wearplate are not acceptable.
       8. A removable wearplate of Hi Chrome shall be provided in back of the impeller designed to direct flow from behind the impeller to the center of the volute for maximum protection to the casing. Wearplates that incorporate a stuffing box are not acceptable.
       9. The pump casing shall be of the two-piece radially split type, with a separate and removable suction piece designed so that the impeller can be withdrawn without the need to remove the discharge casing or disturb the discharge piping. The casing shall be constructed so that it can be reversed for opposite rotation, and shall be of Hi Chrome.
       10. The pump’s head vs. capacity curve shall slope upward toward shutoff in one continuous curve with no points of inflection capable of causing hunting at any pump operational speed.
       11. Pumps shall be equipped with slotted raised-face flanges to receive 125 lb standard bolting. Special case slots shall be cast in to retain bolts and to fasten the case to the bearing housing and to the intake for easy case removal.
    2. Materials of Construction
       1. The parts exposed to abrasive wear – case, removable suction piece, impeller, and wearplate – shall be of all Hi Chrome material conforming to ASTM Designation A532- 75 Class I, Type A, and be a minimum of 700 Brinell hardness for maximum wear resistance. Brinell values below this are not acceptable.
       2. Test bars shall be cast integrally with the case and suction piece and shall remain attached to the casting upon final delivery to the owner. Test bars shall be of sufficient thickness to represent the average thickness of the cast part. After receipt of final delivery, the owner may at any time prior to the final acceptance, remove the test bar and independently verify compliance to the material and hardness specification. Failure of the tested bars to meet the specified requirements shall be cause for rejection.
    3. Bearing Housing
       1. The bearing housing shall be of cast iron, ASTM A48CL-25.
       2. The shaft shall be of ASTM A108, Grade 1141 or equal steel, and shall be protected throughout the packing area by a removable, hardened stainless steel shaft sleeve conforming to ASTM A582 Type 416.
       3. Bearings shall be oil bath lubricated. The oil reservoir shall be sealed at both ends to prevent entrance of foreign matter. The thrust bearings shall consist of three angular contact ball bearings for maximum protection from all thrust loads. The bearing housing shall be equipped with a pressure venting device and oil fill and drain taps. A built-in sight glass shall be furnished to check proper oil level. The bearings shall be rated for a minimum B10 life of 100,000 hours, without credit for any rear pump-out vanes to balance hydraulic thrust.
    4. Shaft Sealing
       1. Mechanical Seal
       1. A single cartridge mechanical seal requiring no external flushing shall be furnished in the pump. The seal shall utilize a rotational sealing ring mounted in an elastomer cup with an o-ring mounted stationary ring loaded by a non-fouling, conical spring encapsulated in Viton. Installation of the seal shall require no measurements or scribe marks on the shaft.
       1. The rotational sealing ring shall be made of tungsten carbide Grade VC 805, the surface of which shall be lapped to a flatness not to exceed three helium light bands. The sealing ring shall be bonded inside a Viton rubber cup, which shall have three (3) integrally molded anti-rotational lugs to prevent the rotary seal face from turning within the rotary body. Additionally, the rotary body shall have three (3) 1/8" solid stainless steel pins to also prevent the rotary seal face from turning within the rotary body.
       1. The stationary sealing ring shall be constructed of d alpha-sintered type silicon carbide. The surface shall be lapped to a flatness not to exceed three helium light bands. The stationary ring shall have a slot milled on the side opposite of the
