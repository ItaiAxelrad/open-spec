	1. MANUFACTURER
   1. The equipment covered by this specification shall be standard products as manufactured by Gould’s Water Technology or an equivalent having a minimum of 20 years’ experience in the production of such equipment. All pumps and pump components specified in this specification shall be supplied by a single pump manufacturer. The pump manufacturer shall be required to supply the pumps and drivers, and shall be responsible for their compatibility only.
2. A factory authorized service facility shall have trained service technicians and be able to show evidence of parts inventory for routine maintenance items such as bearings, gaskets, shafts, and sleeves. 
	1. OPERATION SELECTION
3. Stated total dynamic head (TDH) includes lift and all system pressure. Pump manufacturer shall include pump’s internal loses. 
4. The pump horsepower requirements for any point on the curve shall not utilize the service factor nor exceed the motor nameplate horsepower rating. 
5. The suction can shall be sized such that the internal velocities do not exceed the standards recommended by the Hydraulic Institute. 
6. The inlet shall be designed such that it is in keeping with the Hydraulic Institute recommendations with regard to flow velocity and vertical centerline relationship between inlet nozzle and suction bell.
	1. MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION
7. The vertical turbine lineshaft can pump shall conform to the materials of construction for open lineshaft design. 
8. Bowl Assembly 
	1. The suction bell shall be designed to provide conservative entrance velocities and direct the flow to the first stage impeller. The inner surface of the suction bell shall be smooth and free of sharp projections which could cause turbulence or cavitation. The suction bell shall be designed to house the suction bell bearing by means of four vanes. 
	2. The bowls shall be smooth and free of sharp projections and shall have register fits for alignment and be connected by flanged and bolted construction. Bowl sizes 6" to 15" shall be porcelain enameled on the bowl interior. Bowl sizes 16" and larger shall be epoxy-lined. 
	3. The impellers shall be machined and finished smooth to insure proper performance. They are to be balanced prior to assembly.
9. Column Assembly
	1. The column shall include flanged connections and shall be of open lineshaft design with product lubrication.
	2. The bearing spacing shall be selected to insure operation at a minimum of 25% above or below the first critical speed.


	1. The interior of the column shall be free of offsets, burrs, discontinuities and irregularities. 
	2. The lineshaft shall be of adequate size to transmit the full power of the pump without slip, excessive vibration or elongation, and shall have keyed joints. Lineshaft lengths shall not exceed 10 feet. The lineshaft shall have left hand threads that tighten during pump operation.
   1. Discharge Head Assembly
2. The discharge head shall be fabricated steel type L.
3. For underground sevice with a motorstand, the discharge head shall be fitted with a flanged discharge connection. The discharge head shall be designed to carry the entire weight of the complete pump and driver without distortion when spanning an opening of sufficient size to permit removal of the complete pump assembly. The discharge head shall be provided with a coupling guard. Lifting lugs shall be provided as standard.
4. The stuffing box shall be designed for 6 rings of packing and lantern ring. An extra-long bearing shall be located below the packing in the stuffing box. Packing lubrication leakage through the stuffing box shall be drained back to the sump. The packing gland shall be of a two-piece design.
5. Driver
    1. The driver will be a VHS electric motor. The driver and any related equipment will ship unmounted from the pump to ship. 
   1. Can
   1. The can diameter shall be sized such that the velocity in the can does not exceed the standards recommended by the Hydraulic Institute. The suction can shall be supplied by the manufacturer. 

	1. TESTING
   1. All factory testing shall conform to the most current edition of the Hydraulic Institute Standards. All pump performance testing shall be performed at the manufacturer’s facility. (Specify if there are any additional standards)

3. Hydrostatic testing shall be witnessed in compliance with HI14.6. Hydro testing is to be performed on the pressure containing components. Certified test results shall be provided for approval prior to shipment. 
4. A standard 10 business days’ notice shall be given to the engineer before starting any witness testing. The manufacturer shall not be responsible for expenses including, but not limited to travel, food, and lodging to observe all witness testing.
5. A written approval for all witness testing is required prior to release for shipment. All non-witness testing shall require written prior to release for shipment. 
6. Field/functional testing will be performed by the contractor to insure proper mechanical operation at the jobsite. All testing data to be used for evaluation shall be performed at the pump manufacturer's facility.
7. Motor tests and test reports shall be provided as required in accordance with the motor specification.
