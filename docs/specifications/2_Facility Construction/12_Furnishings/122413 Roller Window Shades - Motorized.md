   1. Maximum offset from level:
      1. 1/16 inch per 5 feet of shade width.
   1. ADJUSTING
   1. Adjust drive / brake mechanism of units for smooth operation. Adjust shade and shadecloth to hang flat without buckling or distortion. Replace any units or components which do not hang properly or operate smoothly.
   1. CLEANING
   1. Touch up damaged finishes and repair minor damage in order to eliminate evidence of repair. Remove and replace work that cannot be satisfactorily repaired.
   1. Clean exposed surfaces, including metal and shadecloth, using non-abrasive materials and methods recommended by the Shadecloth Manufacturer. Remove and replace work which cannot be satisfactorily cleaned.
