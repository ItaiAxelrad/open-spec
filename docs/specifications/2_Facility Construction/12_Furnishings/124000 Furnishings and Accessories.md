      1. A chair that may or may not rotate, with or without arms; usually partially upholstered, with a nontilt fixed back.
   1. Static function load:
      1. Load equivalent to normal use of a file
   1. STC:
      1. Sound transmission coefficient of acoustical panels
   1. Table instability:
      1. Wobble and/or shake frequently resulting from a base size not in proportion to the top size of a table.
   1. Welt:
      1. A fabric-covered cord sewn into the seam of upholstery for ornamental purposes or to improve the durability of the covering.
