Before starting elevator installation, inspect hoistway, hoistway openings, pits and machine rooms, as constructed, verify all critical dimensions, and examine supporting structures and all other conditions under which elevator work is to be installed. Do not proceed with elevator installation until unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected in a manner acceptable to the installer.
   1. Installation constitutes acceptance of existing conditions and responsibility for satisfactory performance.
1. INSTALLATION
   1. Install elevator systems components and coordinate installation of hoistway wall construction.
   1. Work shall be performed by competent elevator installation personnel in accordance with ASME A17.1, manufacturer's installation instructions and approved shop drawings.
   1. Comply with the National Electrical Code for electrical work required during installation.
   1. Perform work with competent, skilled workmen under the direct control and supervision of the elevator manufacturer's experienced foreman.
   1. Supply in ample time for installation by other trades, inserts, anchors, bearing plates, brackets, supports, and bracing including all setting templates and diagrams for placement.
   1. Jack unit excavation:
      1. Drill or otherwise excavate below elevator pit construction as required to install the jack unit.
   1. Install casing for jack unit.
   1. Set casing for jack unit assembly plumb, and fill water, settled sand, eliminating voids.
   1. Set jack unit-cylinder assembly plumb, centered accurately and shimmed to proper elevation, using centering lugs to prevent dislocation during filling. Fill space between casing and cylinder with clean, dry, compacted sand.
   1. Welded construction:
      1. Provide welded connections for installation of elevator work where bolted connections are not required for subsequent removal or for normal operation, adjustment, inspection, maintenance, and replacement of worn Parts. Comply with AWS standards for workmanship and for qualification of welding operators.
   1. Coordination:
      1. Coordinate elevator work with the work of other trades, for proper time and sequence to avoid construction delays. Use benchmarks, lines, and levels designated by the Contractor, to ensure dimensional coordination of the work.
   1. Install machinery, guides, controls, car and all equipment and accessories to provide a quiet, smoothly operating installation, free from side sway, oscillation or vibration.
   1. Sound isolation:
      1. Mount rotating and vibrating elevator equipment and components on vibration-absorption mounts, designed to effectively prevent the transmission of vibrations to the structure, and eliminate sources of structure-borne noise from the elevator system.
   1. Alignment:
      1. Coordinate installation of hoistway entrances with installation of elevator guide rails for accurate alignment of entrances with cars. Where possible, delay final adjustment of sills and doors until car is operable in shaft. Reduce clearances to minimum safe, workable dimensions at each landing.
   1. Erect hoistway sills, headers, and frames before erection of rough walls and doors; erect fascias and toe guards after rough walls finished. Set sill units accurately aligned and slightly above finish floor at landings.
   1. Lubricate operating parts of system, including ropes, as recommended by manufacturer.
   1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Acceptance testing:
      1. Upon completion of the elevator installation and before permitting use of elevator, perform acceptance tests as required and recommended by Code and governing regulations or agencies. Perform other tests, if any, as required by governing regulations or agencies.
   1. Advise Owner, Contractor, Architect, and governing authorities in advance of dates and times tests are to be performed on the elevator.
   1. ADJUSTING
   1. Make necessary adjustments of operating devices and equipment to ensure elevator operates smoothly and accurately.
   1. CLEANING
   1. Before final acceptance, remove protection from finished surfaces and clean and polish surfaces in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations for type of material and finish provided.
   1. At completion of elevator work, remove tools, equipment, and surplus materials from site. Clean equipment rooms and hoistway. Remove trash and debris.
   1. PROTECTION
   1. At time of Substantial Completion of elevator work, or portion thereof, provide suitable protective coverings, barriers, devices, signs, or other such methods or procedures to protect elevator work from damage or deterioration. Maintain protective measures throughout remainder of construction period.
   1. DEMONSTRATION
   1. Instruct Owner's personnel in proper use, operations, and daily maintenance of elevators. Review emergency provisions, including emergency access and procedures to be followed at time of failure in operation and other building emergencies. Train Owner's personnel in normal procedures to be followed in checking for sources of operational failures or malfunctions.
   1. Make a final check of each elevator operation, with Owner's personnel present, immediately before date of substantial completion. Determine that control systems and operating devices are functioning properly.
