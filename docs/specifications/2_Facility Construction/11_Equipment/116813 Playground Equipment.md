2. Poured-in-place surface system installation:
	1. Primer: Where necessary, shall be applied at a rate of 300 sq. ft. per gallon to the substrate or geotextile fabric on the substrate using a short nap roller.
	2. Base Mat:
		1. Urethane to rubber ratio of 13.64% (12/88), which equals a mix of 12% urethane and 88% rubber, by weight, to achieve maximum resilience.
		2. Using trowel, SBR/binder mix shall be spread in a consistent density to specified thickness at a rate of 31lbs. and 13 oz. total weight per cubic foot to the specified depth.
		3. SBR/binder mix shall be allowed to cure (necessary time varies based on temperature and humidity).
	3. Primer: Where necessary, shall be applied at a rate of 300 sq. ft. per gallon to the base mat using a short nap roller.
	4. Top Course:
		1. Urethane to rubber ratio of 21.95% (18/82), which equals a mix of 18% urethane and 82% rubber, by weight, to achieve maximum wear ability and resilience.
		2. Using trowel, EPDM/binder mix shall be spread in a consistent density to specified thickness at a rate of 2.44 lbs. per square foot, which yields a nominal thickness of 1/2".
		3. EPDM/binder mix shall be allowed to cure (necessary time varies based on temperature and humidity).
3. Play Equipment Installation:
