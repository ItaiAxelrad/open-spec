## General

 Design Requirements:
      1. Fume hoods required under this specification will be referenced as:
         1. Laminar Flow Fume Hoods (LFH).
   1. Fume Hood Configurations:
      1. Provide in sizes and configurations with fume hood bases as shown on the drawings.
   1. Performance Characteristics
   1. All cabinets of size and type as indicated on the hood schedule shall be a bench style, single pass flow-through design in which all HEPA filtered work zone (downflow) and work access inflow air, is drawn through the cabinet's internal exhaust plenums to a single exit point at the top.
   1. Air shall be drawn into the HEPA filter by the internal supply blower from a prefilter at the top of the cabinet. The air shall exit the HEPA filter through a diffuser into the work zone in a laminar manner. The air shall split at the removable work surface with ½ being drawn into a rear inlet grill and ½ drawn into the front inlet grill along with the work access inflow. The combination of the downflow and inflow into the front inlet grill forms an “air barrier” that creates the “personnel protection factor”.
   1. Laminar Flow Hoods shall be provided with two-speed blower motor control and sash position sensor to provide the following operation:
      1. Sash in the open position shall signal the blower motor to operate at “normal”, or full speed, and shall signal the Variable Air Volume system to operate at full volume.
   1. Sash in the closed position shall signal the blower motor to operate at “low speed” and shall signal the Variable Air Volume system to operate at low setpoint volume.
   1. Coordinate controls with Section 15910 – Laboratory Hood Instrumentation and Control.
   1. The area beneath the removable work surface shall form a leak-tight exhaust plenum that shall drain to a single, polypropylene, 3/8-inch, ball-type drain valve. The drain valve shall be plumbed to a polypropylene “p-trap” or dead ended into a ball valve. 1½- inch vent holes shall be provided through the bottom of the plenum/cabinet to provide venting for the base cabinets below. One vent hole shall be provided for each base cabinet door and they shall be protected from plenum spills by 3-inch high “mushroom capped” stand pipes.
   1. The supply HEPA filter shall be the full cabinets’ work surface width and depth and removable from the front of the cabinet. The work zone shall be the same fixed cross sectional area as the HEPA filter.
   1. The positive pressure supply plenum shall be surrounded by negative pressure, including the interface of the supply HEPA filter and the filter frame in order to preclude any gasket leaks from contaminating the HEPA filtered work zone air.
   1. The downflow air velocity from a clean HEPA filter shall average from 55 to 65 LFPM with no single point more than 20% above or below the average velocity measured in a horizontal plane defined by the bottom edge of the sash at nominal working height (10-inches).
   1. Minimum average inflow velocity through the work access opening shall be 105 LFPM with a 10-inch nominal sash opening. Working sash heights shall vary between 8 and 12-inches without a loss of the “personnel protection factor”. The maximum non-working height shall be 28-inches.
   1. The exhaust volumes and negative static pressures required per cabinet size shall not exceed the following based on an average inflow velocity of 105 FPM at a work access opening height of 10-inches and an average internal downflow velocity of 65 LFPM.

   1. EXECUTION
   1. INSTALLATION
   1. Fume Hood Base Installation:
      1. Temporarily set fume hood bases plumb, square, and straight with no distortion using the leg levelers adjustable from with the hood base. Use polypropylene shims as required for added support.
   1. Fume Hood Installation:
      1. Set fume hood on base cabinet and using base cabinet leg levelers plumb, square and straight with no distortion. Fasten fume hood to bases from inside the base cabinet, through perimeter base cabinet strips, using TFE coated screws, recessed and plugged. Once the work surface is level and true, the bases shall be fastened to the floor via a treated wood backer installed behind the toe kick. Adjust levelers/shims. All screws shall be TFE coated, recessed and covered with a polypropylene plug.
   1. Accessory Installation:
      1. Install sinks and accessories in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
   1. ADJUSTING
   1. Repair or remove and replace defective work, as directed by Owner's Representative upon completion of installation.
   1. Adjust sash, doors, hardware, fixtures and other moving or operating parts to function smoothly.
   1. CLEANING
   1. Remove all remaining protective masking from the cabinet.
   1. Clean finished fume hood, work surfaces, and accessories. Touch up as required, wipe down and vacuum the interior of the equipment. Wipe down with Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) or Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) cleaning agent to remove dust and dirt from the surface. Consult MSDS for precautions.
   1. PROTECTION OF FINISHED WORK
   1. Provide all necessary protective measures to prevent exposure of the vertical laminar flow fume hood to other construction activity during operational test and balancing. In particular high concentrations of aerosols caused by spray painting or plaster dust can seriously shorten the lifetime of the HEPA filter.
   1. Advise contractor of procedures and precautions for protection of material, installed fume hood and fixtures from damage by work of other trades.
