## General

   1. Manufacturer:
      1. Specification is based on Model CAP 412 Mode ‘WO’ Clean Bench table top vertical laminar flow clean bench as manufactured by Clean Air Products, Minneapolis, MN. Equal products as manufactured by one of the following are acceptable:
      1. Terra Universal, Anaheim, CA
   1. Purified MicroEnvironments, Ormond Beach, FL
   1. Design:
      1. Based on Clean Air Products Model CAP412-6T30 WO, providing a nominal work surface of 6 ft. by 30 in. deep with solid stainless steel benchtop.
   1. Laminar flow bench shall be designed to provide a smooth, uniform downward air flow across the entire work surface free from turbulance and to provide a Class 100 Work Zone in accordance with Federal Standard 209E.
   1. Design shall allow transport of the unit through a 34” wide (clear) door opening.
   1. Design shall allow for all control and maintenance access from the front of the unit.
   1. The cabinet plenum surrounding the HEPA filter shall be maintained at a negative pressure relative to the ambient pressure.
   1. Construction:
      1. All structural components shall be a minimum of 16 gauge cold rolled steel. The support frame shall be fabricated of 2 inch by 4 inch steel tubing with cross bracing of 2 inch by 2 inch steel tubing.
   1. Sides of work zone shall be clear acrylic. Front of unit shall be open.
   1. Filter module shall be all welded cabinet of 16 gauge cold rolled steel.
   1. Cabinet and structure finish shall be white baked-on enamel with corrosion protection.
   1. Base shall be constructed of heavy duty steel tubing with solid stainless steel top surface. Provide base units with storage cabinets, maintaining 36” clear width knee space below the worksurface for seated operation.
   1. air flow and filter module
   1. Air Flow:
      1. Velocity shall be factory pre-set at 90 fpm (plus or minus 20 fpm) in accordance with Fed Std 209E.
   1. The blower-motor assembly shall be sized to provide the proper air flow with increase in HEPA filter static pressure drop of 50%.
   1. Blower shall be a squirrel cage forward curved style with direct drive. Motor shall be direct drive continuous duty with thermal protection. Blower and motor shall be dynamically balanced. Both motor and blower shall be vibration isolated.
   1. Blower motor assembly shall be provided with a solid state speed control to maintain correct air flow velocity. Controller shall have RFI suppression and transient high voltage protection.
   1. Assembled unit shall not exceed 65 dBa with an ambient noise level of 55 dBa.
   1. Units shall be provided with a pre-filter and HEPA filter.
   1. Prefilter shall be a standard sized disposable fiberglass type, rated 40% per the NBS Atmospheric Dust Test. Prefilters shall be located on the top of the unit.
