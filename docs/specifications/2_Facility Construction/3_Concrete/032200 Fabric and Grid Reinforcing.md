   1. PRODUCTS
1. 2.1 MATERIALS
   1. Welded Wire
	1. Conform to ASTM A185.
2. Accessories
	1. Tie Wire: 
		1. Minimum 16 gage annealed type. Acceptable patented system.
	2. Chairs, Bolsters, Bar Supports, Spacers: 
		1. Sized and shaped for strength and support of reinforcement during installation and placement of concrete.
   1. EXECUTION
1. 3.1 ERECTION INSTALLATION APPLICATION
   1. Install in longest practicable length. 
2. Welded wire fabric shall be set on wire chairs or "hooked" during placement of concrete to maintain 3/4" cover.
3. Lap adjoining pieces one full mesh plus 2 inches minimum and securely wire. 
4. Do not make laps midway between simple supported members or directly over support members of continuous structures. 
5. Offset laps in adjacent widths to prevent continuous laps.
6. Extend fabric through contraction joints and construction joints unless otherwise indicated on the Drawings. 
7. Detailing, fabrication, and placement of reinforcing steel shall be in accordance with ACI 315, Standard Practice for Detailing Reinforced Concrete Structure.
8. Except as noted on the Drawings, concrete protection for reinforcement shall be in accordance with ACI 318 and as follows:
	1. Concrete not exposed to earth or weather.
1. 3.2 FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Metal reinforcing, at the time concrete is placed, shall be free from rust, scale, or other coatings, which will destroy or reduce the bond.
