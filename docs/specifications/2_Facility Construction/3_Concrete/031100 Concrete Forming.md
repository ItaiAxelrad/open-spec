## Execution

1. 3.1 Preparation
   1. Form Surface Treatment:
	1. Before placing of either reinforcing steel or concrete, cover surfaces of forms with an approved coating material that will effectively prevent absorption of moisture and prevent bond with concrete, will not stain concrete or prevent bonding of future finishes.
		1. A field applied form release agent or sealer of approved type or a factory applied non-absorptive liner may be used.
	2. For water containing structures provide form oil which will not be toxic after 30 days after application.
	3. Do not allow excess form coating material to stand in puddles in forms nor in contact with hardened concrete against which fresh concrete is to be placed, or coat reinforcing steel.
2. Provide temporary openings at base of column and wall forms and at other points where necessary to facilitate cleaning and observation immediately before concrete is placed, and to limit height of free fall of concrete to prevent aggregate segregation.
	1. Temporary openings to limit height of free fall of concrete shall be spaced no more than 8 FT apart.
3. Clean surfaces of forms, reinforcing steel and other embedded materials of any accumulated mortar or grout from previous concreting and of all other foreign material before concrete is placed.

11. When required for concrete curing in hot weather, required for repair of surface defects or when finishing is required at an early age, remove forms as soon as concrete has hardened sufficiently to resist damage from removal operations or lack of support.

14. Formwork for columns, walls, sides of beams, and other parts not supporting weight of concrete may be removed as soon as concrete has hardened sufficiently to resist damage from removal.
15. Where no reshoring is planned, leave forms and shoring used to support weight of concrete in place until concrete has attained its specified 28 day compressive strength.
	1. Where a reshoring procedure is planned, supporting formwork may be removed when concrete has reached the concrete strength required by the formwork designer's structural calculations.
16. When shores and other vertical supports are so arranged that non-load-carrying form facing material may be removed without loosening or disturbing shores and supports, facing material may be removed when concrete has sufficiently hardened to resist damage from removal.
