1. REPAIRS TO DAMAGED CONCRETE SURFACES
1. Minor surface damage to hardened cast-in-place or precast concrete may be repaired, at the discretion of the City Engineer, using the specified materials in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and the following procedures:
1. Cast-in-place or precast concrete for manholes and vaults:
1. Remove loose or deteriorated concrete to expose a fractured aggregate surface with an edge cut to a ninety-degree angle to the existing surface. Clean all debris from the area, apply a 20-mil coat of epoxy bonding agent to the prepared surface, and place repair mortar while the epoxy is still wet and tacky. On horizontal surfaces, for repair depths greater than 2", add aggregate to the repair mortar as recommended by the manufacturer. On vertical or overhead surfaces, for repair depths greater than 2", apply the repair mortar in successive lifts, scarifying the lifts, allowing them to harden, and applying a scrub coat of the material prior to proceeding with the next lift. Cure the material as for concrete in accordance with this specification.
1. General Purpose: 13. Remove loose and deteriorated concrete by mechanical means, sandblasting or high-pressure water blasting. Clean all debris from the area and apply non-shrink grout in a 1/4” minimum thickness, at the desired consistency, ranging from a dry pack, to a fluid-poured into a formed area, according to the application. Cure the material as for concrete in accordance with this specification.
1. DAMP-PROOFING FOR THE EXTERIOR OF CONCRETE STRUCTURES
   1. Following completion of the exterior surfaces of manholes and vaults, including necessary repairs and piping penetrations into the structure, apply the specified material to prepared concrete surfaces in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The surfaces to be coated shall be fully cured and free of laitance and contamination. The material shall be applied to all exterior surfaces below a point 12” above the water table or indications of seepage or moisture as directed by the City Engineer. Apply two 5 mil coats, curing between coats, prior to backfill and/or immersion in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
