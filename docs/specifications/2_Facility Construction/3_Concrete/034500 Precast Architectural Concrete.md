15. Welding:
   1. Perform welding in compliance with AWS D1.1 and AWS D1.4 with qualified welders.
16. Protect precast concrete units and bearing pads for damages by field welding or cutting operation and provide noncombustible shields as required.
17. Weld equipment, materials and process to be compatible with base metal.
18. Repair damaged steel surfaces by cleaning and applying a coat of liquid galvanizing repair compound as per, ASTM A780 to galvanized surfaces and a coat of compatible primer on painted surfaces.
19. Bolting
    1. At bolted connection, use lock washers or other acceptable means to prevent loosing of nuts.
20. Grouting
    1. Grout connections where indicated on shop drawings or where required.
    2. Retain grout in place until hard enough to support it self. Pack spaces with stiff grout material until voids are completely filled. Place grout to finish smooth, level and plumb with adjacent concrete surfaces. Promptly remove gout material from exposed surfaces before it affects finishes or hardens.
    3. Keep grouted joints damp for not less than 24 hours after initial set.
21. Damaged Units
    1. Do not install units having broken corners or edges, spalls, cracks or other defects in the Work. Remove units erected and later found to be broken, spalled, cracked or otherwise damaged, and replace with approved units matching the adjacent work, unless patching of minor defects is approved in writing.
22. Final Cleaning
    1. After installation and joint treatment clean soiled precast concrete surfaces, starting at the top of the structure, with detergent and water, using fiber brush and sponge, and rinse thoroughly with clean water in accordance with precast concrete manufacturer's recommendation. Use cleaning materials or processes which will not change the character of exposed concrete finishes.
    2. Use extreme care to prevent damage to precast concrete surfaces and to adjacent materials.
    3. Rinse thoroughly with clean water immediately after using cleaner.
