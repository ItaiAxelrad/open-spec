      1. 
	1. The maximum reinforcement ratio allowed is one-half the reinforcement ratio that would produce a balanced strain condition.
	2. Earth pressure shall be converted to a horizontal pressure using a coefficient of earth pressure at rest of 0.5 and not a coefficient of active earth pressure.
	3. Include a live load surcharge of 2 feet of soil in the design of the walls. '
4. Precast vault construction shall be in the form of monolithic walls or horizontal wall sections; do not use panel walls.
5. Minimum wall thickness shall be 6 inches. Design knockout wall panels to accommodate loading pressures defined above.
6. Design and construct vaults to be watertight when subjected to groundwater over the entire height of the vault. 
7. Provide openings in precast vaults for piping and access. Provide cast in place inserts in the roof slab and end walls at the locations as shown on the Drawings. No field coring of openings is allowed.
1. 2.3 Precast Concrete Risers

1. 2.8 Vault Appurtenances
   1. Provide ladders, covers and frames, vents, supports, inserts, eyebolts, and other miscellaneous metalwork. Refer to Section 05 50 00.


## Execution

   1. Excavating and Backfilling for Vaults
2. Perform earthwork as specified in Standard Specification Section 31 01 00. Provide 6-inch minimum thickness 3/4-inch crushed rock over the full width of the vault base and extend 12 inches beyond the edges of the vault. After repairing the waterproofing, backfill and compact around the vault with structural backfill material. Excavated material may be used for structural backfill provided it conforms to the Standard Specifications for structural backfill material.
	1. **Installation of Vaults and Risers
3. Set each precast concrete vault section or riser plumb on a double layer bed of sealant at least 1/2-inch thick to make a watertight joint with the preceding unit. Point the inside joint and wipe off the excess sealant.
	1. **Waterproofing
4. Waterproofing shall be factory applied to all exterior surfaces of vaults and risers. This includes the bottom of the vault to be coated as an exterior surface. Apply two coats at a rate of 65 square feet per gallon per coat. Prior to backfilling, field apply waterproofing material on joints and damaged surfaces. Protect coating from damage during backfilling and compacting.
