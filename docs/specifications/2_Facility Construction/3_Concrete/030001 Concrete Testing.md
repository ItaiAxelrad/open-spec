      6. Location of cores shall be determined by Engineer so as least to impair strength of structure.
      7. If, before testing, one (1) or more of cores shows evidence of having been damaged subsequent to or during removal from structure, damaged core shall be replaced.
      8. Concrete in area represented by a core test will be considered adequate if average strength of three (3) cores is equal to at least 85 percent of specified strength and no single core is less than 75 percent of specified strength.
      9. Fill core holes with non-shrink grout and finish to match surrounding surface when exposed in a finished area.
