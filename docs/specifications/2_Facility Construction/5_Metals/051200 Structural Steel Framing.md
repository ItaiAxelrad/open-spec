   1. Level and plumb individual members of the structure within specified AISC tolerances.
   1. Establish required leveling and plumbing measurements on the mean operating temperature of the structure, making allowances for the difference between temperature at time of erection and the mean temperature at which the structure will be when completed and in service.
   1. Comply with AISC specification for bearing, adequacy of temporary connections, alignment, and removal of paint on surfaces adjacent to welds.
   1. Gas cutting
   1. Do not use gas-cutting torches for correcting fabricating errors in structural framing, except on secondary members where acceptable to the Owner.
