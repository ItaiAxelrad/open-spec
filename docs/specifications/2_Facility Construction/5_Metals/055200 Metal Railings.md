## Product

1. Materials
   1. Metal Handrails:
      1. Standard Steel Pipe, Architectural Handrail Grade, of diameter and sizes indicated.
	1. Exterior metal handrails shall be galvanized. 
	2. Provide terminal safety returns for all stair handrails. 
	3. Handrail brackets shall be galvanized malleable iron, manufactured for the purpose, for anchorage to concrete walls. Include all fittings and components, sleeves, hardware, backing plates, and accessories as required for complete and finished handrail installations.
2. Steel Pipe:
	4. Pipe for railings, pipe supports, and pipe sleeves shall be seamless steel pipe, conforming to ASTM A53, Type S, Grade A, of diameters and sizes indicated. 
	5. Special instructions shall be given the pipe manufacturer to provide Architectural Handrail Grade pipe.
3. Plate:
      1. Steel plate for anchor plates shall be standard steel plate, conforming to ASTM A36, weldable quality.
4. Anchors, Fasteners, and Accessories:
      1. Provide all required anchors, fasteners, miscellaneous components, and accessories as required for complete and finished railing installations. 
	6. Bolts and studs, nuts, and washers shall conform with ASTM A307, A449, and A563, as applicable, and shall be galvanized in accordance with ASTM A153.
		1. Expansion Bolts: Where anchors are not included in the concrete construction, provide galvanized expansion type anchors with matching galvanized steel bolts or studs with nuts, of sizes as indicated or required. Provide washers under all bolt heads and nuts. Expansion bolts require approval of the Engineer before they may be installed in posttensioned slabs. Expansion bolts will not be permitted for use on concrete curbs or along the edge of concrete or a concrete joint.
5. Paint:
      1. Corrosion-inhibitive protective metal primer.
6. Grout:
      1. Non-shrink grout shall be utilized. 
1. Fabrication
   1. Metal handrails and railings shall be fabricated by firms or shops experienced and skilled in the custom fabrication of architectural metal handrails and railings, and shall meet the quality requirements of NAAMM's Pipe Railing Manual.
8. Bends in rails shall be precision-formed to a smooth continuous radius by skilled workers. Work quality and finish shall be true to detail. Butt joints shall have internal pipe sleeve or dowel. Ends shall be closed with similar materials, welded and ground smooth.
9. Welding shall be performed in the shop unless otherwise indicated. Welded joints of handrails and railings shall be ground and dressed smooth to match adjacent surfaces and so that the shape and profile of the item welded is maintained.
10. Metal handrails and railings shall be prefabricated and preassembled in the factory or shop as far as practicable.
11. Galvanizing
   1. Ferrous metal railings and related items on the exterior of the building, or as otherwise indicated, shall be galvanized, after fabrication, by the hot-dip process in accordance with ASTM A123 and ASTM A385. Weight of zinc coating shall conform to requirements specified under "Weight of Coating" in ASTM A123.

## Execution

1. Installation
   1. Install metal handrails and railings conforming to the installation requirements of NAAMM's Pipe Railing Manual.
   2. Install metal handrails and railings with accessories furnished by the railing fabricator as required for complete and finished railing installations.
   3. After installation, exposed painted surfaces, field welds, and other abraded or damaged primed surfaces shall be prepared as required and touched up with an additional coat of the same primers for ferrous and galvanized surfaces.
