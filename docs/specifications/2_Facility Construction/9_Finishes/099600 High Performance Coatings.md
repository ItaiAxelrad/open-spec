## Execution

   1. Inspection
   1. Starting of coating Work is construed as the applicator's acceptance of surfaces within any particular area.
   1. Preparation

## General

   1. Remove hardware, hardware accessories, machined surfaces, plates, lighting fixtures, and similar items which are not to be coated, or provide surface-applied protection prior to surface preparation and coating operations. Remove these items if it is necessary for the complete coating of the items and adjacent surfaces. Following completion of coating operations in each space or area, reinstall the items removed, using workmen skilled in the trades involved.
   1. Clean surfaces to be coated before applying coatings or surface treatments. Schedule cleaning and coating application so that dust and other contaminates will not fall on wet, newly coated surfaces.
   1. Surface Preparation
   1. Perform surface preparation and cleaning in compliance with the manufacturer's instructions for the particular substrate conditions, and as specified.
   1. Notify the Architect in writing of anticipated problems in using the specified coating systems with substrates primed or furnished by others.
   1. Cementitious surfaces
   1. Prepare cementitious surfaces of concrete, concrete masonry, cement plaster and similar surfaces scheduled to receive special coatings by removing efflorescence, chalk, dust, dirt, grease and oils, and by roughing if necessary to remove glaze.
   1. Use abrasive blast cleaning methods if recommended by the coating system manufacturer.
   1. Determine alkalinity and moisture content of surfaces to be coated by performing appropriate tests. Do not apply coatings over surfaces where moisture content exceeds that permitted in the manufacturer's printed directions.
   1. Acid-etch concrete floor surfaces scheduled to receive special coatings with a 5 percent solution of muriatic acid or other proprietary cleaner. Flush the floor with clean water to remove acid, and neutralize with ammonia and rinse; allow to dry.
   1. Wood surfaces
   1. Clean wood surfaces of dirt, oil, and other foreign substances, using scrapers, mineral spirits, and sandpaper as needed. Sand smooth the surfaces exposed to view, and dust off.
   1. Scrape and clean small, dry, seasoned knots and apply a thin coat of white shellac or other recommended knot sealer, before application of priming coat.
   1. Ferrous metal surfaces
   1. Clean non-galvanized, ferrous metal surfaces, that have not been shop-coated, of oil, grease, dirt, loose mill scale and other foreign substances. Use solvent or mechanical cleaning methods complying with the recommendations of SSPC.
   1. Blast clean steel surfaces as recommended by the coating system manufacturer and in accordance with the requirements of SSPC (SP-10) (SP-6).
   1. Treat bare and sandblasted or pickled clean metal with a metal treatment wash coat prior to priming.
   1. Touch-up shop applied prime coats which have been damaged, and bare areas. Wire-brush, solvent clean, and touch-up with the same primer as the shop coat.
   1. Non-ferrous metal surfaces
   1. Clean non-ferrous and galvanized surfaces in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for the type of service, metal substrate and application required.
   1. Material Preparation
   1. Carefully mix and prepare materials in compliance with the coating manufacturer's directions.
   1. Do not mix coating materials produced by different manufacturers, unless otherwise permitted by the manufacturer's instructions.
   1. Stir materials before application to produce a mixture of uniform density, and as required during application. Do not stir film, which may form on surfaces, into the material. Remove film and, if necessary, strain the coating material before using.
   1. Tinting
   1. Tint each under coat a lighter shade to facilitate identification of each coat where multiple coats of the same material are to be applied. Tint undercoats to match the color of the finish coat, but provide sufficient difference in shade of undercoats to distinguish each separate coat.
   1. Application

## General

   1. Apply special coatings by brush, roller, spray, squeegee, or other applicators in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. Use brushes best suited for the type of material being applied. Use rollers of carpet, velvet back, or high-pile sheep's wool as recommended by the manufacturer for the material and texture required.
   1. Apply additional coats when undercoats or other conditions show through the final coat, until the cured film is of uniform coating finish, color and appearance.
   1. Coating colors, surface treatments and finishes are as indicated.
   1. Provide finish coats that are compatible with the primers used.
   1. The number of coats and coating film thickness required is the same regardless of the application method. Do not apply succeeding coats until the previous coat has cured as recommended by the coating manufacturer. Sand between coating applications where sanding is required to produce an even, smooth surface in accordance with the coating manufacturer's directions.
   1. Coat surfaces behind movable equipment and furniture the same as similar exposed surfaces.
   1. Coat the back sides of access panels, removable or hinged covers, and similar hinged items, to match exposed surfaces.
   1. Minimum Coating Thickness
   1. Apply each material at not thinner than the manufacturer's recommended spreading rate. Provide a total dry film thickness of the entire coating system as recommended by the manufacturer.
   1. Prime Coats
   1. Before the application of finish coats, apply a prime coat, as recommended by the coating manufacturer, to material that is required to be painted or finished, and which has not been prime coated by others.
   1. Recoat primed and sealed substrates where there is evidence of suction spots or unsealed areas in the first coat, to assure a finish coat with no burn-through or other defects due to insufficient sealing.
   1. Brush Application
   1. Brush-out and work brush coats into surfaces in an even film. Eliminate cloudiness, spotting, holidays, laps, brush marks, runs, sags, ropiness, and other surface imperfections. Neatly draw glass lines and color breaks.
   1. Apply primers and first coats by brush unless the manufacturer's instructions permit use of mechanical applicators.
   1. Mechanical Applications
   1. Use mechanical methods for coating application when permitted by the coating manufacturer's recommendations, governing ordinances, and trade union regulation.
   1. Wherever spray application is used, apply each coat providing the equivalent hiding of brush-applied coats. Do not doubleback with spray equipment building-up film thickness of 2 coats in one pass, unless recommended by the coating manufacturer.
   1. Completed Work
   1. Match approved samples for color, texture and coverage. Remove, refinish or recoat Work not in compliance with specified requirements.
   1. Field Quality Control
   1. Testing Procedures
   1. The Owner reserves the right to invoke the product testing procedure at any time, and at any number of times during the period when coating operations are being conducted.
   1. The Owner will engage the services of an independent testing laboratory to sample the coating being used. Samples of products delivered to Project site will be taken, identified and sealed, and certified in the presence of the Contractor.
   1. The testing laboratory will perform appropriate tests for any or all of the following characteristics as required by the Owner:
      1. Quantitive materials analysis.
   1. Absorption.
   1. Accelerated weathering.
   1. Accelerated yellowness.
   1. Color retention.
   1. Alkali resistance.
   1. Mildew resistance.
   1. Abrasion resistance.
   1. Apparent reflectivity.
   1. Washability.
   1. Dry opacity.
   1. Recoating.
   1. Skinning.
   1. If test results show products being used do not comply with specified requirements, the Contractor may be directed to stop work, and remove non-complying products, pay for testing, recoat surfaces coated with rejected products, or remove rejected products from previously coated surfaces if, upon recoating with the specified products, the two coatings are not compatible.
   1. Cleaning
   1. Clean Up
   1. At the end of each work day during progress of Work, remove rubbish, empty cans, rags and other discarded materials from the site.
   1. Upon completion of the Work, clean window glass and other spattered surfaces. Remove spattered coatings by washing, scraping or other proper methods, using care not to scratch or otherwise damage adjacent finished surfaces.
   1. Protection
   1. Protect Work of other trades, whether being coated or not, against damage from coating operations. Correct damage by cleaning, repairing or replacing, and recoating as acceptable to the Architect. Leave the Work in an undamaged condition.
   1. Provide "wet paint" signs as required to protect newly-coated finishes. Remove temporary protective wrappings provided by others for protection of their work, after completion of coating operations. At completion of the Work of other trades, touch-up and restore damaged or defaced coated surfaces.
