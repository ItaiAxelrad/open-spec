## Execution

1. SURFACE PREPARATION
   1. All contaminants including oil, grease, waxes, sealers, salts, surface laitance or other contaminants shall be removed.
   1. Surfaces to be coated must be clean, firm, and dry.
   1. Contractor shall utilize abrasive grit blasting or high-pressure water blasting equipment to provide the correct profile for bonding and to clean the substrate. Surface preparation procedures shall be in accordance with ICRI (International Concrete Repair Institute) Guideline No. 03732, or comparably approved method. Surface preparation requirement is to expose aggregate and obtain a uniform surface texture resembling an ICRI CSP comparator #3-5.
   1. Level or grind concrete substrates to manufacturer's recommended tolerances and to produce a smooth, uniform installation, including removal of all sharp edges, ridges, or depressions.
2. APPLICATION OF PROTECTIVE COATING
   1. Application procedures shall conform to the recommendations and Instruction for Use provided by the coating manufacturer, to include material handling, mixing, environmental controls during application, safety, and equipment.
   1. Application is to be carried out by manufacturer-certified craftsmen only.
   1. A manufacturer's representative shall be onsite to certify and supervise the application.
   1. Concrete surfaces to receive protective coating shall be cast with rough form finish. Surfaces shall not be rubbed, troweled, or otherwise finished in any manner that will obscure or cover the firm substrate surface. All subsequent surface washing, abrasive blasting, grinding, patching, filling, and preparation shall be completed by the Applicator in accordance with the protective coating manufacturer's recommendations.
   1. All concrete shall cure for 28 days before protective coating system is installed, unless otherwise recommended by the Applicator or system manufacturer.
   1. All voids, depressions, bug holes, or other imperfections that may result in out gassing or pinholes during lining installation shall be filled with epoxy filler compound. 
3. COATING SCHEDULE
   1. Coating shall be in two (2) applications, each minimum 10 mils dry film thickness (DFT).
4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   1. High Voltage Spark Testing. Installed protective coating shall be tested for pinholes after a minimum 24-hour cure at a temperature of 70째F. Pinhole testing shall be accomplished using a Tinker Razor Holiday Detector, San Gabriel, CA, Model AP/W, or an approved equal device. Test voltage of 100 volts/mil of coating thickness shall be applied. All pinholes shall be marked and required using manufacturer's approved Patch Kit, or other approved method.
