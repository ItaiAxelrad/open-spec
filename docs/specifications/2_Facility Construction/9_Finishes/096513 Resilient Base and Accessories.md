## Execution

   1. Examination
   1. Verify that substrates and conditions are satisfactory. Do not allow resilient base and accessories work to proceed until unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.
   1. preparation
   1. Prepare substrate surfaces as follows:
      1. Use leveling and patching compounds as recommended by the manufacturer for filling small cracks, holes and depressions in substrates.
   1. Remove coatings, including curing compounds, and other substances that are incompatible with adhesives and that contain soap, wax, oil, or silicone, using mechanical methods recommended by manufacturer. Do not use solvents.
   1. Broom and or vacuum clean substrates to be covered, and inspect substrates for moisture, alkaline salts, carbonation or dust.
   1. Flooring Transition Accessories
   1. Resilient Edge Strips (Reducers)
   1. Provide resilient edge strips where floor covering terminates exposing the edge of the covering. Center under door where floor covering terminates at a door opening, or as indicated.
   1. Resilient Thresholds
   1. Center resilient thresholds in door opening, unless otherwise indicated.
   1. Divider Strips
   1. Provide divider strip where resilient flooring finishes against other applied type of flooring and no other protection is provided.
   1. Set divider strips level, straight and true, at proper height, and bonded to substrate with adhesive recommended by manufacturer.
   1. Installation
   1. Fit resilient materials to finish flush with abutting flooring and against flooring and other abutting materials, with no joint greater than 1/64 inch. Scribe to configuration of door frames and other abutting construction.
   1. Bond resilient materials securely to substrate in full bed of adhesive.
   1. Resilient Base
   1. Installation
   1. Cut base material into accurate lengths as required for minimum number of joints. Match edges at all seams or double-cut adjoining lengths.
   1. Bond base to substrates in full bed of adhesive. Install with tight butt joints with no joint widths greater than 1/64 inch. Press down so that bottom cove edge follows floor profile. Top and bottom edges shall have firm contact with floor and wall surfaces.
   1. Form internal corners by mitering. Form external corners by coping and bending material sufficient length around corner for anchorage.
   1. Scribe base accurately to abutting materials.
   1. Provide base against front and exposed sides of all casework and on wall at knee spaces.
   1. Provide base on wall behind casework where resilient flooring extends under casework.
   1. Provide base on columns in areas scheduled to receive resilient flooring.
   1. On masonry surfaces or other similar irregular substrates, fill voids along top edge of base with manufacturer's recommended adhesive filler material.
   1. Resilient Stair Covering
   1. Installation - General
   1. Bond resilient materials securely to substrates in full bed of adhesive.
   1. Treads
   1. Fit integral nosing and cut back edge to profile of stair. Fill with caulking compound the open space at nosing between stair and resilient tread.
   1. Landings
   1. Allow resilient sheet material to flatten prior to installation. Fit material to finish flush with tread and against riser and other abutting materials with no joint width greater than 1/64 inch. Match grain and color between adjacent pieces.
   1. Risers
   1. Set riser after tread is installed.
   1. Resilient Corner Guards
   1. Installation
   1. Bond corner guards to substrates in full bed of adhesive.
   1. Cleaning

   1. Protection
   1. Protect the Work against mars, marks, indentations and other damage from construction operations and placement of equipment and fixtures during the remainder of the construction period. Use protection methods recommended in writing by resilient product manufacturer.
