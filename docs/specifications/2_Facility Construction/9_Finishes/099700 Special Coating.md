	1. General:
      1. Remove hardware and hardware accessories, plates, machined surfaces, lighting fixtures, and similar items already installed that are not to be painted. If removal is impractical or impossible because of the size or weight of the item, provide surface-applied protection before surface preparation and painting.
   1. After completing painting operations in each space or area, reinstall items removed using workers skilled in the trades involved.
   2. Cleaning:
      1. Before applying paint or other surface treatments, clean the substrates of substances that could impair the bond of the various coatings. Remove oil and grease before cleaning.
   3. Schedule cleaning and painting so dust and other contaminants from the cleaning process will not fall on wet, newly painted surfaces.
   4. Surface Preparation:
      1. Clean and prepare surfaces to be painted according to manufacturer's written instructions for each particular substrate condition and as specified.
   5. Provide barrier coats over incompatible primers or remove and reprime.
   6. Ferrous Metals:
      1. Clean ungalvanized ferrous-metal surfaces that have not been shop coated; remove oil, grease, dirt, loose mill scale, and other foreign substances. Use solvent or mechanical cleaning methods that comply with the Steel Structures Painting Council's (SSPC) recommendations.
   7. Blast steel surfaces clean as recommended by the paint system manufacturer and in accordance with requirements for scheduled Special Coatings.
   8.  Galvanized Surfaces:
      1. Clean galvanized surfaces with nonpetroleum-based solvents so surface is free of oil and surface contaminants. Remove pretreatment from galvanized sheet metal fabricated from coil stock by mechanical methods.
   9.  Cementitious Materials:
      2. Remove efflorescence, caulk, dust, dirt, grease, oils, and release agents. Roughen as required to remove glaze. If hardeners or sealers have been used to improve curing, use mechanical methods of surface preparation.
   10. Materials Preparation:
      3. Mix and prepare paint materials according to manufacturer's written instructions.
   11. Maintain containers used in mixing and applying paint in a clean condition, free of foreign materials and residue.
   12. Stir material before application to produce a mixture of uniform density. Stir as required during application. Do not stir surface film into material. If necessary, remove surface film and strain material before using.
   13. Use only thinners approved by paint manufacturer and only within recommended limits. E. Tinting:
      4. Tint each undercoat a lighter shade to facilitate identification of each coat where
   14. multiple coats of the same material are applied. Tint undercoats to match the color of the finish coat, but provide sufficient differences in shade of undercoats to distinguish each separate coat.
3.  APPLICATION
   15. Special Coatings Vacuum:
      1. Suitable industrial type vacuum cleaners shall be provided and used to remove all residual sand and dust from all surfaces after sandblasting and prior to coating. All coated surfaces shall be cleaned before subsequent coats are applied. Particular attention shall be given to removal of sand and dust from welds, lids and edges of structural shapes and other crevices where sand may be trapped.
   16. Special Coatings Ventilation:
      2. Adequate ventilation shall be maintained by the Contractor at all times inside the tank during and following sandblasting and painting. Ventilation should have sufficient capacity to maintain a clean atmosphere within the tank during both sandblasting and coating operations. In addition, ventilation shall be maintained at least 24 hours after each day’s painting and during the entire period in which the coating is curing prior to being filled, this will prevent entrapment of solvent in the painted surface. Adequate lighting shall be provided for all blasting and coating operations inside the tank. Floodlighting shall be sufficient to light the entire working area without shadow areas. Only vapor tight lighting shall be used.
	2. General:
      1. Apply paint according to manufacturer's written instructions. Use applicators and techniques best suited for substrate and type of material being applied. All paint shall be free from cracks, blisters, crazing and other defects.
    1.  Paint colors, surface treatments, and finishes are indicated in the schedules.
    2.  Do not paint over dirt, rust, scale, grease, moisture, scuffed surfaces, or conditions detrimental to formation of a durable paint film.
    3.  Provide finish coats that are compatible with primers used.
    4.  The term "exposed surfaces" includes areas visible when permanent or built-in fixtures, grilles, and similar components are in place. Extend coatings in these areas, as required, to maintain the system integrity and provide desired protection.
    5.  Paint surfaces behind movable equipment the same as similar exposed surfaces. Before the final installation of equipment, paint surfaces behind permanently fixed equipment or furniture with prime coat only.
    6.  Paint back sides of access panels and removable or hinged covers to match exposed surfaces.
    7.  Sand lightly between each succeeding enamel coat.
    8.  Omit primer on metal surfaces that have been shop-primed and touch-up painted.
   1. Scheduling Painting:
      1. Apply first coat to surfaces that have been cleaned, pretreated, or otherwise prepared for painting as soon as practicable after preparation and before subsequent surface deterioration.
    9.  The number of coats and the film thickness required are the same regardless of application method. Do not apply succeeding coats until the previous coat has cured as recommended by the manufacturer. If sanding is required to produce a smooth, even surface according to manufacturer's written instructions, sand between applications.
    10. If undercoats, stains, or other conditions show through final coat of paint, apply additional coats until paint film is of uniform finish, color, and appearance. Give special attention to ensure edges, corners, crevices, welds, and exposed fasteners receive a dry film thickness equivalent to that of flat surfaces.
    11. Allow sufficient time between successive coats to permit proper drying. Do not recoat surfaces until paint has dried to where it feels firm, does not deform or feel sticky under moderate thumb pressure, and where application of another coat of paint does not cause the undercoat to lift or lose adhesion.
       1. Application Procedures:
          1. Apply paints and coatings by brush, roller, spray, or other applicators according to manufacturer's written instructions.
    12. Brushes:
          1. Use brushes best suited for the type of material applied. Use brush of appropriate size for the surface or item being painted.

          1. Use rollers of carpet, velvet back, or high-pile sheep's wool as recommended by the manufacturer for the material and texture required.
    14. Spray Equipment:
      2. Use airless spray equipment with orifice size as recommended by the manufacturer for the material and texture required.
   2. Minimum Coating Thickness:
      1. Apply paint materials no thinner than manufacturer's recommended spreading rate. Provide the total dry film thickness of the entire system as recommended by the manufacturer.
   3. Special Coatings Minimum Coating Thickness:
      1. Apply materials at not less than the manufacturer's recommended spreading rate. Provide a total dry-film thickness of the entire system as specified in Section 3.8 - PAINTING SCHEDULE. To ensure uniformity of application, the dry film thickness shall meet the specified minimum on 90% of the readings taken using a dry film thickness gauge. Readings shall be taken uniformly over any given area. No area will be acceptable where any dry thickness is more than 10% below the specified minimum or more than 25% over the maximum.

   4. Surface Preparation:
         1. Remove efflorescence, chalk, dust, dirt, grease, oils, and release agents. Roughen as required to remove glaze. If hardeners or sealers have been used to improve curing, use mechanical methods of surface preparation.
   5) Use abrasive blast-cleaning methods per SSPC–SP13/NACE 6 Surface
      1. Preparation of Concrete.
      2. 2) Determine alkalinity and moisture content of surfaces by performing appropriate tests. If surfaces are sufficiently alkaline to cause the finish paint to blister and burn, correct this condition before application. Do not paint surfaces where moisture content exceeds that permitted in manufacturer’s written instructions.
         1. Clean per ASTM D4258 using air or vacuum methods only.
         2. Fill air pockets or bug holes having diameters greater than ¼ inch with an acceptable filler such as Sikatop 107 Polymer-Modified Repair Mortar (Sika Chemical Corporation), or equal. And remove form fins and ridges greater than 1/8 inch. Filler shall be compatible with the epoxy and coal tar epoxy coatings furnished. Supply written confirmation of compatibility.
