1. PRIMER
	1. Exposed surfaces shall be prime coated with a blend of petrolatum, plasticizer, and corrosion inhibitor having a paste-like consistency. The material shall have the following properties:
   1. Pour Point 400-100° F 
   2. Flash Point 350° F minimum 
   3. Approximate Coverage 1 gal/100 square feet 
   4. Color Brown 
   5. The primer shall be Trenton Wax-Tape Primer or equivalent. 
2. WAX TAPE
	1. Two types of petrolatum wax tape shall be available from the manufacturer:

   1. Buried Installations:
      1. The covering material shall be a plastic-fiber felt tape, saturated with a blend of petrolatum, plasticizers, and corrosion inhibitors that is easily formable over irregular surfaces. The tape shall have the following properties:
   2. Color Brown 
   3. Saturant Pour Point 115° - 125°F 
   4. Thickness 70-90 mils 
   5. Dielectric Strength 170 volts/mil 
   6. Tape Width 6 inches 
   7. Wax tape shall be Wax-Tape #1 as manufactured by The Trenton Corporation (Ann Arbor, Michigan), or approved equal. 
3. OUTER COVERING

   1. Width 6 inches 
   2. Thickness 1.5 mils 
   3. Dielectric Strength 2000 volts/mil 
   4. Water Absorption Negligible 
   5. Color Clear 
   6. The outer covering shall be Trenton Poly-Ply or approved equal. 
4. OTHER PETROLATUM WAX TAPE SYSTEM COMPONENTS
	1. Any components not listed above, but required for a complete petrolatum wax tape coating system as recommended for this application by the manufacturer shall be provided at no additional cost to Owner. 

## Execution
