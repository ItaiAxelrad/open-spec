2. preparation 5. Protection 6. Protect the Work and adjacent construction against damage. 7. Surface Preparation 8. Prepare concrete to "open" the surface pores by means of vacuum blasting, removing all contaminants or bond breaking substances, including but not limited to dust, laitance, curing compounds, coatings, sealers, oil and grease. Chemically remove any oil and grease not removed by vacuum blasting. Mechanically remove all delaminated or deteriorated concrete by scabbling or chipping hammers. Saw-cut areas to be patched to a minimum 13 mm (1/2 inch) deep at the perimeters to form a key to the existing concrete. Follow manufacturer's instructions regarding preparation of concrete and non-concrete substrates. 9. Rout cracks and non-expansion joints less than 1.6 mm (1/16-inch) wide after surface preparation and fill with underlayment. 10. Fill joints in masonry behind base with underlayment. 11.

14. Do not subject flooring to traffic for a minimum of 24-hours or as recommended by manufacturer, whichever is greater.
15. Allow resinous flooring to fully cure for fourteen (14) days before subjecting to water or chemical tests.
16. cleaning
17. Clean the Work upon completion, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
18. protection
19. Allow finish coats to cure a minimum of 24 hours before permitting light foot traffic on the floor and a minimum of 7 days before permitting heavy traffic on the floor.
