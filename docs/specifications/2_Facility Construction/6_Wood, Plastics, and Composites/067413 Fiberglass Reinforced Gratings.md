11. 2.3 Molded FRP Grating
   1. Manufacture:
      1. 
	1. Grating shall be of a one piece molded construction with tops and bottoms of bearing bars and cross bars in the same plane. 
	2. Grating shall have (a square mesh pattern providing bidirectional strength or a rectangular mesh pattern providing unidirectional strength - choose one). 
	3. Grating shall be reinforced with continuous rovings of equal number of layers in each direction. The top layer of reinforcement shall be no more than 1/8" below the top surface of the grating so as to provide maximum stiffness and prevent resin chipping of unreinforced surfaces. 
	4. Percentage of glass (by weight) shall not exceed 35% so as to achieve maximum corrosion resistance, and as required to maintain the structural requirements of the CONTRACT.
	5. After molding, no dry glass fibers shall be visible on any surface of bearing bars or cross bars. All bars shall be smooth and uniform with no evidence of fiber orientation irregularities, interlaminar voids, porosity, resin rich or resin starved areas.
