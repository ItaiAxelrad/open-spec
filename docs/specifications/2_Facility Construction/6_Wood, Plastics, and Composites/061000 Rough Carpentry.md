      3. Pressure-treat material in accordance with AWPA U1.
   3. Fasteners and Anchors see Section 05 50 00 on Metal Fabrications.

## Execution

1. Preparation
   1. Verify measurements, dimensions, and shop drawing details before proceeding.
2. Coordinate location of studs, nailers, blocking, grounds and similar supports for attached work.
3. Eliminate sharp projections which would puncture roofing, flashing or underlayment material.
4. Erection and Installation, General:
   1. Provide preservative treated material for all wood used outside the building or below grade.
5. Attach work securely by anchoring and fastening as required to support applied loading.
   1. Provide stainless steel anchors, bolts, and nuts, unless otherwise noted.
   2. Provide washers under bolt heads and nuts.
   3. Fasten plywood in accordance with APA recommendations
      1. Use galvanized nails and screws unless otherwise indicated.
      2. When anchoring treated wood material use appropriately treated fasteners for corrosion protection against the chemicals used in the wood treatment process.
   4. Use common wire nails or screws for general work.
   5. Use fasteners of size that will not penetrate members where opposite side will be exposed to view or receive finish materials.
   6. Install fasteners without splitting of wood; predrill as required.
   7. Do not drive threaded friction type fasteners.
   8. Tighten bolts and lag screws at installation and retighten as required.
6. Set work to required levels and lines, plumb, true.
   1. Shim as required.
   2. Cut and fit accurately.
7. Provide wood grounds, nailers, or blocking where required for attachment of other work and surface applied items.
   1. Form to shapes indicated or required.
      1. Field treat cuts and holes in preservative treated material in accordance with AWPA M4 and manufacturer’s published recommendations.
   2. Install roofing nailers as indicated:
      1. Install per roofing manufacturer's recommendations.
      2. Match height of nailers to insulation.
      3. Anchor nailers to resist force of 300 PLF unless required otherwise by roofing manufacturer.
         1. Concrete decking attachment:
         1. Attach base nailer to concrete roof deck using minimum 3/8 IN stainless steel adhesive anchors with minimum 3 IN embedment.
         1. Countersink heads of bolts flush with top of nailer.
         1. Provide spacing of anchorage as required to meet loading criteria specified.
      4. Provide 1/2 IN vent spaces between lengths of nailers.
      5. Install nailers over vapor retarder.
8. When wood has been exposed to moisture allow to completely dry out prior to covering with additional wood or another material.
9. Correct or replace wood which shows bowing, warping or twisting to provide a straight, plumb and level substrate for applications of other materials.
