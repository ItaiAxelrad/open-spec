## Execution

1. 3.1 Examination
   1. Examine substrates, flashing conditions, penetrations, adjoining construction and the conditions under which work is to be installed. Verify that surfaces are dry and free of oil, grease, dust, rust, or other contaminant.
2. Report unacceptable conditions in writing. Do not proceed with the Work until unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected and surfaces are acceptable.
3. Verify that fire stopping is in place before beginning to apply the air infiltration barrier with flexible seal technology.
4. Verify the following conditions have been sealed with the air infiltration barrier before installing insulation and before closing in framing cavities:
	1. Gaps between window units and framing.
	2. Gaps between door heads, jambs, and sills and wall framing.
	3. Interface of foundation or slab and sill plate.
	4. Interface of band joists or rim joists and plates and subfloor.
	5. Duct shafts, utility penetrations, knee walls and flue shafts opening to exterior or unconditioned space.
1. 3.2. Preparation
   1. Before beginning work, protect windows, plumbing fixtures, finish materials, and finish surfaces within work area by covering them with a plastic film. Secure edges of film to assure air infiltration barrier with flexible seal technology does not get behind the film.
2. Sweep area to receive air infiltration barrier application to remove dust and other contaminants that will interfere with providing a thorough seal.
3. Fill medium-sized gaps (gaps between 3/8 inch and 3 inches) between surfaces to be sealed with fiberglass insulation. Cover gaps greater than 3 inches with rigid, nonporous material such as gypsum board, extruded polystyrene insulation, sheathing, OSB, particle board, agrifiber particle board, or plywood secured to framing and apply sealant at the perimeter. 
4. Comply with all manufacturer and OSHA safety regulations.
1. 3.3 Installation of Foam Sealant
   1. Foam sealant in accordance with manufacturer’s instruction, including compliance with instructions for safety, preparation, and application of products. Apply continuously and evenly to joints in the following conditions:
	1. At penetrations between conditioned and unconditioned spaces.
	2. At interface between the sheathing and stud where a sheathing seam is known to exist.
	3. At the interface between windows/doors and the framed opening.
	4. On the face of all top plates of exterior walls.
	5. On the face of all top plates of interior walls adjacent to the unconditioned attic space.
	6. At interface between the sill plate and foundation.
	7. At interface between the bottom plate and the sheathing.
	8. At interface between the top plate and the sheathing.
	9. At interface between the bottom plate and the subfloor or slab for first floor of slab-on-grade construction.
	10. At any horizontal, mid-cavity sheathing seams.
	11. At joist bays connecting exterior to conditioned space, such as at garage, porch, or overhang (block and seal).
	12. At attic knee-walls (block and seal).
	13. At insulated floor of room above unconditioned space.
	14. At interface between the band joist and the plate below it.
	15. At interface between the band joist and the subfloor above it.
2. Seal those gaps and penetrations filled with loose fill insulation during preparation and thoroughly cover them with foam sealant.
3. Do not install foam sealant within 3 inches of a heat source with exception of recessed light fixtures, which may be sealed at the interface with the drywall. 
1. 3.4 Installation of Insulation, General

3. Install in exterior walls, roof and ceiling spaces without gaps or voids. Fluff insulation to full thickness for specified R-value before installation. Do not compress insulation.
4. Trim insulation neatly to fit spaces. Insulate miscellaneous gaps and voids.
5. Fit insulation tight in spaces and tight to exterior side of mechanical and electrical services within the plane of insulation.
6. For unfaced batt insulation, install with friction fit or retain in place with manufacturer’s recommended fasteners or mesh.
7. For batt insulation with factory-applied facing, install with vapor retarder membrane facing warm side of building spaces. 
	1. Lap ends and side flanges of membrane over or between framing members.
