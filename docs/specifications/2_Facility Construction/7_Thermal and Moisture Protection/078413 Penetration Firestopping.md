## Execution

1. EXAMINATION
   1. Examine substrates and conditions, with Installer present, for compliance with requirements 
for opening configurations, penetrating items, substrates, and other conditions 
   1. affecting performance of work.
1. Proceed with installation only after unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.
2. PREPARATION
   1. Surface Cleaning:
      1. Clean out openings immediately before installing 
through-penetration firestop systems to comply with firestop system manufacturer's written 
   1. instructions and with the following requirements:
         1. Remove from surfaces of opening substrates and from penetrating items foreign materials that 
   1. could interfere with adhesion of through-penetration firestop systems.
2. Clean opening substrates and penetrating items to produce clean, sound surfaces capable of 
   1. developing optimum bond with through-penetration firestop systems. Remove loose particles 
   1. remaining from cleaning operation.
3. Remove laitance and form-release agents from concrete.
   1. Priming:
      1. Prime substrates where recommended in writing by through-penetration firestop 
system manufacturer using that manufacturer's recommended products and methods. Confine primers to 
   1. areas of bond; do not allow spillage and migration onto exposed surfaces.
   1. Masking Tape:
      1. Use masking tape to prevent through-penetration firestop systems 
from contacting adjoining surfaces that will remain exposed on completion of Work and that would 
   1. otherwise be permanently stained or damaged by such contact or by cleaning methods used to remove 
   1. smears from firestop system materials. Remove tape as soon as possible without disturbing firestop 
   1. system's seal with substrates.
3. THROUGH-PENETRATION FIRESTOP SYSTEM INSTALLATION
	1. General:
      1. Install through-penetration firestop systems to comply with Part 1 
"Performance Requirements" Article and with firestop system manufacturer's written installation 
   1. instructions and published drawings for products and applications indicated.
   1. Install forming/damming/backing materials and other accessories of types required to 
support fill materials during their application and in the position needed to produce 
   1. cross-sectional shapes and depths required to achieve fire ratings indicated.
1. After installing fill materials and allowing them to fully cure, remove combustible 
   1. forming materials and other accessories not indicated as permanent components of firestop 
   1. systems.
   1. Install fill materials for firestop systems by proven techniques to produce the following 
results:
      1. Fill voids and cavities formed by openings, forming materials, accessories, and 
   1. penetrating items as required to achieve fire-resistance ratings indicated.
2. Apply materials so they contact and adhere to substrates formed by openings and penetrating 
   1. items.
3. For fill materials that will remain exposed after completing Work, finish to produce smooth, 
   1. uniform surfaces that are flush with adjoining finishes.
4. IDENTIFICATION
   1. Identify through-penetration firestop systems with preprinted metal or plastic labels. 
Attach labels permanently to surfaces adjacent to and within 6 inches of edge of the firestop 
   1. systems so that labels will be visible to anyone seeking to remove penetrating items or firestop 
      1. Use mechanical fasteners for metal labels. For plastic labels, use self-adhering type 
with adhesives capable of permanently bonding labels to surfaces on which labels are placed and, in 
   1. combination with label material, will result in partial destruction of label if removal 
    1. is attempted. Include the following information on labels:
    1. The words "Warning - Through-Penetration Firestop System - Do Not Disturb. Notify
   1. Building Management of Any Damage."
2. Sub-contractor's name, address, and phone number.
3. Through-penetration firestop system designation of applicable testing and inspecting agency.
4. Date of installation.
5. Through-penetration firestop system manufacturer's name.
6. Installer's name.
5. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Inspecting Agency:
      1. Contractor shall engage a qualified, independent inspecting agency to 
inspect through-penetration firestops. Independent inspecting agency shall comply with 
   1. ASTM E 2174 requirements including those related to qualifications, conducting inspections, and 
   1. preparing test reports.
   1. Where deficiencies are found, repair or replace through-penetration firestop systems so 
they comply with requirements.
   1. Proceed with enclosing through-penetration firestop systems with other construction only 
after inspection reports are issued and firestop installations comply with requirements.
6. CLEANING AND PROTECTING
   1. Clean off excess fill materials adjacent to openings as Work progresses by methods and with 
cleaning materials that are approved in writing by through-penetration firestop system 
   1. manufacturers and that do not damage materials in which openings occur.
   1. Provide final protection and maintain conditions during and after installation that ensure 
that through-penetration firestop systems are without damage or deterioration at time of project 
      1. If, despite such protection, damage or deterioration occurs, cut out and remove 
damaged or deteriorated through-penetration firestop systems immediately and install new materials 
   1. to produce systems complying with specified requirements.
