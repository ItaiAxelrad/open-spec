2. Verify that concrete is visibly dry and free of moisture. Test for capillary moisture by plastic sheet method according to ASTM D 4263.
3. Proceed with installation only after unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.
2. SURFACE PREPARATION
   1. Clean, prepare, and treat substrates according to manufacturer's written instructions. Provide clean, dust-free, and dry substrates for waterproofing application.
   1. Mask off adjoining surfaces not receiving waterproofing to prevent spillage and overspray affecting other construction.
   1. Remove grease, oil, bitumen, form-release agents, paints, curing compounds, and other penetrating contaminants or film-forming coatings from concrete.
   1. Remove fins, ridges, mortar, and other projections and fill honeycomb, aggregate pockets, holes, and other voids.
   1. Prepare, fill, prime, and treat joints and cracks in substrates. Remove dust and dirt from joints and cracks according to ASTM D 4258.
   1. Corners:
      1. Prepare, prime, and treat inside and outside corners according to ASTM D 6135.
1. Install membrane strips centered over vertical inside corners. Install 3/4-inch fillets of liquid membrane on horizontal inside corners and as follows:
      1. At footing-to-wall intersections, extend liquid membrane each direction from corner or install membrane strip centered over corner.
      1. At plaza deck-to-wall intersections, extend liquid membrane or sheet strips onto deck waterproofing and to finished height of sheet flashing.
   1. Prepare, treat, and seal vertical and horizontal surfaces at terminations and penetrations through waterproofing and at drains and protrusions according to ASTM D 6135.
3. MODIFIED BITUMINOUS SHEET WATERPROOFING APPLICATION
   1. Install modified bituminous sheets according to waterproofing manufacturer's written instructions and according to recommendations in ASTM D 6135.
   1. Apply primer to substrates at required rate and allow to dry. Limit priming to areas that will be covered by sheet waterproofing in same day. Reprime areas exposed for more than 24 hours.
   1. Apply and firmly adhere sheets over area to receive waterproofing. Accurately align sheets and maintain uniform 2-1/2-inch-minimum lap widths and end laps. Overlap and seal seams and stagger end laps to ensure watertight installation.
1. When ambient and substrate temperatures range between 25 and 40 deg F, install self- adhering, modified bituminous sheets produced for low-temperature application. Do not use low-temperature sheets if ambient or substrate temperature is higher than 60 deg F.
   1. Apply continuous sheets over sheet strips bridging substrate cracks, construction, and contraction joints.
   1. Seal exposed edges of sheets at terminations not concealed by metal counter flashings or ending in reglets with mastic.
   1. Repair tears, voids, and lapped seams in waterproofing not complying with requirements. Slit and flatten fishmouths and blisters. Patch with sheet waterproofing extending 6 inches beyond repaired areas in all directions.

repair substrates, reapply waterproofing, and repair sheet flashings.
4. MOLDED-SHEET DRAINAGE PANEL INSTALLATION
   1. Place and secure molded-sheet drainage panels, with geotextile facing away from wall or deck substrate, according to manufacturer's written instructions. Use adhesives that do not penetrate waterproofing. Lap edges and ends of geotextile to maintain continuity. Protect installed molded-sheet drainage panels during subsequent construction.
