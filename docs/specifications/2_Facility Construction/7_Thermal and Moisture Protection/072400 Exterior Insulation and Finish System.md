## Execution

   1. SURFACE CONDITIONS
   1. Examine the areas and conditions under which work of this Section will be performed. Correct conditions detrimental to timely and proper completion of the Work. Do not proceed until unsatisfactory conditions are corrected.
   1. As necessary, provide proper remedy for:
      1. Substrata contrary to recommendations of the manufacturer of the approved system.
   1. Defects or coatings on substrata that will adversely affect execution and quality of the Work;
   1. Hot spots, other residue, and releasing agents such as silicones and oils;
   1. Planar irregularities greater than 1/4".
   1. MIXING
   1. If the Dryvit system has been approved for the use on this Work, use the following procedures. Modify the procedures as approved by the Owner in the event other system has been approved.
   1. Adhesive:
      1. For mixing and preparing adhesive:
            1. Use a clean container, free from all foreign substances;
   1. Do not use a container which has been used for a petroleum product, or which has been cleaned with a petroleum product;
   1. Immediately after mixing, clean the containers and mixing equipment.
   1. Use a mixer similar to "Goldblatt Jiffer Mixer Number 15311H7," powered by 1/2" drill at 400 to 500 rpm.
   1. Stir the adhesive prior to adding portland cement.
   1. Mix the specified portland cement with the specified adhesive in a ratio of one part portland cement to one part adhesive.
   1. Measure quantities of portland cement and adhesive separately prior to mixing;
   1. Add the cement to the adhesive in small increments while thoroughly mixing each increment;
   1. Add the specified water only as required to adjust workability.
   1. Do not add rapid binders, anti-freeze, accelerators, or any other material except as specifically approved by the Owner and by the manufacturer of the approved system.
   1. Finish:
      1. Using the high speed mixer, thoroughly mix the factory-prepared finish material until a uniformly workable consistency is attained.
   1. Add the specified water only as required to adjust workability.
   1. APPLICATION
   1. Insulation board:
      1. For application to vertical surfaces, begin at the base from firm permanent or temporary support.
   1. Apply the board horizontally in running bond.
   1. Precut the board as required to fit openings and projections, staggering vertical joints at corners.
   1. With a trowel, apply a bead of mixed adhesive 2" wide by 3/8" thick on the entire perimeter of the board.
   1. Also apply dabs of mixed adhesive 3/8" thick by 4" in diameter, approximately 8" on centers in the interior area;
   1. Provide a minimum adhesive area of 25% of the area of the panel.
   1. As an alternative, the Contractor may use a 3/8" notched trowel and apply mixed adhesive to the entire surface.
   1. Apply pressure over the entire surface of the board to achieve uniform contact and high initial grab.
   1. Butt all joints tightly, and achieve an overall flush level surface.
   1. Where irregularities exist, use a rasp and make the surface flush within a tolerance of 1/16".
   1. Install expansion joints and other required items completely embedded in mixed adhesive.
   1. Coating and reinforcing fabric:
      1. Using a stainless steel trowel, apply the mixed adhesive to the entire surface of the insulation board to a uniform thickness of approximately 1/16".
   1. Immediately thereafter, place the specified reinforcing fabric against the coating and, by troweling from the center to the edges, embed the fabric into the coating.
   1. Make reinforcing fabric continuous at corners, and lap not less than 2-1/2" at fabric edges;
   1. Permit no fabric wrinkles;
   1. Completely embed the fabric into the coating.
   1. Where additional impact layers of adhesive and reinforcing fabric are shown on the Drawings, repeat the above procedures after the preceding layer has set up.
   1. Finish:
      1. Do not commence application of finish until coating and reinforcing fabric layers are completely dry and hard.
   1. Using a clean stainless steel trowel, apply a tight coat of the specified finish material directly to the reinforced coating.
   1. Apply and level during the same operation to the minimum thickness obtainable consistent with uniform coverage.
   1. Apply and texture in a continuous operation over a wall surface.
   1. Work to corners and joints, and do not allow finish material to set up within a distinct wall or panel area.
   1. Use sufficient staging and personnel to accomplish a uniform appearance.
   1. Make the final texture after the finish has gelled to where it does not stick to the trowel.
   1. Achieve the approved texture by allowing trowel to roll on the round aggregate, using a variety of motions and trowels or floats to match the approved sample.
   1. Provide a final thickness not greater than the diameter of the largest aggregate of the finish material.
