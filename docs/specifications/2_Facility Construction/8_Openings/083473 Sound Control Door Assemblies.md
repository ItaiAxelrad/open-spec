1. Shop Painting
1. Cleaning
1. Remove oil, grease, sand, dirt and other foreign substances. After cleaning, chemically treat metal surfaces to assure maximum paint adherence.
1. Primed Finish
1. Apply dip or spray coat of rust-inhibitive metallic oxide or synthetic resin metal primer, baked on or oven-dried, to ferrous metal surfaces which are smooth and free from irregularities and rough spots.

## Execution

1. Installation
   1. Require the Work to be installed by the door manufacturer or his authorized representative in accordance with approved Shop Drawings and manufacturer's instructions.
   2. Drill and tap door and frame in field for surface-mounted hardware.
   3. After installation, touch-up abraded areas with prime paint.
   4. Frames
   5. Install frames prior to construction of enclosing walls and ceilings. Brace frames securely until permanent anchors are set. Anchor bottom of frames with anchor bolts and lead expansion shields, or with drop-in expansion bolts. Build wall anchors into walls, or secure wall anchors to adjoining construction. Provide required wedging or blocking for frames. Remove and reinstall frames that exceed the recommended tolerances.
