## Execution

1. INSTALLATION A. General:
   1. Comply with manufacturer's written instructions.
2. Do not install damaged components.
3. Fit joints between aluminum components to produce hairline joints free of burrs and distortion.
4. Rigidly secure nonmovement joints.
5. Install anchors with separators and isolators to prevent metal corrosion, electrolytic deterioration, and immobilization of moving joints.
6. Seal joints watertight unless otherwise indicated.
7. Installation is from the outside of the building.
   1. Metal Protection:
      1. Where aluminum components will contact dissimilar materials, protect against galvanic action by painting contact surfaces with corrosion-resistant coating or by installing nonconductive spacers as recommended in writing by manufacturer for this purpose.
   1. Install continuous aluminum sill closures with weatherproof expansion joints and locked and sealed corners. Locate weep holes at rafters.
   1. Install components to drain water passing through joints, condensation occurring within aluminum members, and moisture migrating within assembly to exterior.
   1. Install components plumb and true in alignment with established lines and elevations.
   1. Erection Tolerances:
      1. Install panel assemblies to comply with the following maximum tolerances:
      1. Alignment:
         1. Limit offset from true alignment to 1/32 inch where surfaces abut in line, edge to edge, at corners, or where a reveal or protruding element separates aligned surfaces by less than 3 inches; otherwise, limit offset to 1/8 inch.
8. Location and Plane:
   1. Limit variation from true location and plane to 1/8 inch in 12 feet, but no greater than 1/2 inch over total length.
9. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Testing Agency:
      1. Contractor shall engage a qualified testing agency to perform tests and inspections.
10. Water-Spray Test:
    1. Before installation of interior finishes has begun, panel assemblies shall be tested according to AAMA 501.2 and shall not show evidence of water penetration.
