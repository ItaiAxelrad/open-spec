   1. Obtain units from one manufacturer, cured by one process and of uniform texture and color, for each type required for each continuous area and visually related areas.
1. DELIVERY, STORAGE AND PROTECTION
   1. Store masonry units above ground on level platforms, which allow air circulation under stacked units.
   1. Cover and protect against wetting prior to use.
   1. Handle units on pallets or flat bed barrows.
   1. Do not permit free discharge from conveyor units or transporting in mortar trays.
1. PROJECT/SITE CONDITIONS
   1. Weather Conditions
   1. Protect masonry construction from direct exposure to wind and sun when erected in an ambient air temperature of 99 F. in the shade with relative humidity of less than 50%.
   1. Do not place masonry units when air temperature is below 40 F.
   1. Job Conditions
   1. Protect sills, ledges, and offsets from mortar drippings or other damage during construction.
   1. Prevent grout and mortar and soil from staining the face of masonry to be left exposed or painted.
