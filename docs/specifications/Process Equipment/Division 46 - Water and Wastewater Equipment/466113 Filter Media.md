		2. Repairs to the existing underdrain have been completed and underdrain distribution has been tested using visual observation in backwash mode.
		3. Repair coatings on filter walls, troughs, and gullet have been completed and are fully cured.
	3. Protect existing troughs, underdrains, and filter appurtenances during installation. Repair or replacement of these systems if damaged by Contractor’s operations will be at no additional cost to the Owner.
	4. Thoroughly clean filter box prior to placement of filter materials in accordance with AWWA C653, Section 2. Maintain clean environment throughout installation and install in a manner which prevents contamination from any source.
	5. Level lines shall be placed on all sides of the filter basin designating the top elevation of each media layer.
	6. Place media in each filter per the depths listed in the following table:
		1. Layer Media Finished Layer Depth
			1. Top - Anthracite - 10”
			2. Bottom - Greensand - 20”
	7. Placement of filter materials shall be in accordance with AWWA B100, Section 5, as modified herein.

	12. Wash filters only when water is available for washing. Except for washing required for first scraping operation, wash only as authorized by Owner.
	13. Filter media depth shall be measured after the completion of backwashing and skimming.
2. Filter Greensand Placement.
	1. Place Greensand in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications.
3. Anthracite Placement.
	1. Anthracite filter media shall not be placed in the filter cell until the filter sand in that cell has been skimmed.

		2. Allow the chlorinated water to stand in the filter for a period of 24 hours with the water level no more than 6 inches below the top of the filter box.
		3. Upon completion of disinfection, waste filter water and thoroughly backwash filter to remove chlorine.
	2. Bacteriological Sampling
		1. After completion of chlorination and prior to placing filters in service, bacteriological testing shall be completed.
		2. At least two samples shall be taken from each filter not less than 30 minutes apart and tested for the presence of coliform.
			1. If no coliforms are detected, the filter may be placed in service.
			2. If coliforms are present in any of the samples, proceed with 1 or 2 as follows:
				1. Take samples 24 hours apart until no coliforms are present.
