9. MP (Medium Pressure) – refers to classification of UV reactor. Other types of reactors and LP (low pressure) and LPHO (low pressure high output).
10. RED (Reduction Equivalent Dose) – The Reduction Equivalent Dose is the UV dose derived by entering the log inactivation measured during full-scale reactor testing into the UV dose-response curve that was derived through collimated beam testing.
11. UVT (Ultraviolet Transmittance) – The ultraviolet transmittance is a measurement of the amount of ultraviolet light (commonly at 254 nm due to its germicidal effect) that passes through a water sample compared to the amount of light that passes through a pure water sample. The measurement is expressed as a percentage, % UVT.
