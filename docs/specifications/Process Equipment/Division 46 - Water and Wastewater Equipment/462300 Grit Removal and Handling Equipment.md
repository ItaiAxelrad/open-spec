		1. Functional Description
			1. Operating Modes
   1. In this description, hardware functions, such as field hand switches, are referred to as “hard” (e.g. hard switch); software functions performed at the OI are referred to as “soft” (e.g. soft switch). Regardless of the mode of operation (described below) process indications will remain active (these may include valve position, motor on or off, VFD speed, process flow measurements, etc) and hard wired alarms and safeties (such as motor overloads or high temperature, etc) will be active and reported by the PLC.

				1. HAND OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the HAND position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall run and the system controls shall not control the device.
				2. LOCAL OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the LOCAL position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment is controlled locally by hard switches, which may include on-off, open-close, etc. and the system controls shall not control the equipment.
				3. OFF POSITION (Hard Switch): When the OFF position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall stop and the system controls shall not control the device.
				4. AUTO OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment shall be controlled automatically by the controls system.
				5. REMOTE OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the REMOTE position is selected at the hard switch the equipment will be controlled automatically by the controls system.
				6. AUTO OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the OI soft switch, the system automatic controls (logic) are enabled and the manual soft switches are disabled (these may include on-off, open close, etc).
				7. MANUAL OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the MANUAL position is selected at the OI soft switch, the manual soft controls are enabled (these may include on- off, open close, etc) and the system automatic controls (logic) are disabled
				8. EMERGENCY STOP (Hard Switch): Equipment can be deactivated at any time by pressing the EMERGENCY STOP push button (where present). The EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton overrides all other controls including remote or automatic controls and the hard HOA switch. EMERGENCY STOP pushbuttons shall be hardwired into the Grit System PLC, and hardwired into the motor starting control circuitry, as shown on the schematics found in the Electrical drawings. For equipment where schematics have not been provided on the contract drawings, integration of hardwire EMERGENCY STOP control shall be included. EMERGENCY STOP push buttons must be manually reset to allow the equipment to run.
			1. AUTOMATIC OPERATION (AUTO or REMOTE mode selected)
   1. The following is a general description of the equipment functions. Complete and detailed functions and logic are to be provided by the Grit Removal Equipment manufacturer. All process set points shall be operator adjustable from the OI. The Grit Removal Equipment manufacturer shall provide initial factory settings of set points based on the specific conditions of this project or “typical” settings if specifics do not apply.

				1. The Grit Cyclone unit is designed to operate continuously. As the grit slurry is pumped through the Grit Cyclone unit, a small volume of classified (washed) grit slurry continuously underflows from the Grit Cyclone. Control of the grit slurry underflow rate is all-hydraulic, with no mechanical or moving parts. All-hydraulic control of the grit slurry underflow rate requires continuous introduction of Supply Water (from the Service Water system) to the Hydraulic Valve mounted on the bottom of the Grit Cyclone and control of the supply of the Supply Water.
				2. Periodically, typically twice an hour during heavy grit loads and typically once every hour during light grit loads, a backwash sequence is initiated to flush the grit underflow gap inside the Grit Cyclone unit. This involves cycling of solenoid valves. Frequency and duration of backwash cycles is operator adjustable.
				3. Periodically, typically once every four (4) backwashes, a blowdown sequence is initiated to flush accumulations of debris inside the Grit Cyclone This involves stopping the flow of grit slurry through the Grit Cyclone, cycling of solenoid valves, and resuming operation. Frequency and duration of blowdown cycles is operator adjustable.
				4. The Grit Washer/Concentrator clarifier section provides sufficient area to settle fixed solids grit onto the continuously running belt with the slurry water overflowing the clarifier weir. The Grit Washer/Concentrator belt shall run whenever grit slurry is being transported to it.
				5. NORMAL OPERATION
   1. There shall be one (1) globe valve and one (1) Slurry Water Valve (SSWV) on the Grit Cyclone Slurry Water line (fed from the Service Water line). The SSWV solenoid valve requires OPEN/CLOSE control. This valve shall open any time the system is operating, allowing the flow of clarified water to the Grit Cyclone. The globe valve shall be adjusted to achieve optimum flow to the Hydraulic Valve, as read on the flow meter.

*

		- 
			* 
				1. BACKWASH SEQUENCE
   1. There shall be one (1) backwash solenoid valve (BWV) on the Grit Cyclone backwash line (fed from the System Water line). The BWV solenoid requires OPEN/CLOSE control for this normally closed valve. During normal operation, this solenoid valve shall be opened for 1-2 minutes when inflow is first introduced into the Grit Cyclone and for 1-2 minutes at intervals while the system is in backwash operation. The backwash frequency and duration shall be operator adjustable. The BWV shall also open during a blowdown sequence.

*

			* 
				1. BLOWDOWN SEQUENCE
   1. An accumulation of debris in the bottom of the Grit Cyclone should be removed periodically depending on screen opening size and plant flow conditions. A Blowdown Sequence requires opening of BWV, and de-energizing the grit pumps to stop the grit slurry feed to the Grit Cyclone for a field adjustable time of typically 2-5 minutes. After this time, grit flow is re-established (by re-starting the Grit Pumps) and BWV is opened for a short time (typically 1-2 minutes). A Blowdown Sequence shall occur after a field adjustable time of typically 2-8 hours. A Blowdown Sequence also occurs at System Shut Down.

* 
	+ 
		- 
			* 
				1. SYSTEM SHUT DOWN SEQUENCE
   1. When the system is to be shut down, a Blowdown Sequence shall be initiated but the grit slurry feed to the Grit Cyclone shall not be restarted. The Grit Washer/Concentrator belt shall run for a minimum amount of time after a System
   1. Shut Down occurs to allow the belt to dewater all the grit that was dumped. The time set shall be adjustable from 0-60 minutes and normally be set at 15 minutes.

				1. GRIT WASHER/CONCENTRATOR CONTROLS
   1. The operating controls shall provide for manual and automatic operation. The controls shall include a variable frequency drive (VFD) to drive the motor. All controls shall be located in NEMA type 4X enclosures. The belt shall run whenever grit slurry is being transported to it.
   1. The belt speed shall be adjustable by a manual speed control potentiometer on the NEMA 4X control panel or by remote signal (4-20ma) from the plant DCS.
   1. A motion sensor shall be installed on the side of the Grit Washer/Concentrator take-up frame. The motion sensor shall protect the system against possible belt stall, drive unit failure, and/or scraper arm overload (too much grit counterbalancing the scraper arm). The motion detector sensor shall detect the cycle of the scraper arm and output a contact closure to a timer. During normal operation, the sensor shall send a signal each time one of the cleats on the belt passes the scraper arm. The timer shall normally be set for the maximum amount of time it takes two cleats to close the motion detector switch. This shall vary with the speed of the belt. If there is lack of belt movement or if there is a scraper arm overload, there shall be no signal from the motion sensor. If the motion sensor fails to reset the timer, the Grit Washer/Concentrator stops and the failure light shall illuminate.
