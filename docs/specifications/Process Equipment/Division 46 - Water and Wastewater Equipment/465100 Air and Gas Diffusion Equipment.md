		1. Programming Requirements:
			1. Programming of the Verticel PLC is the responsibility of the Verticel equipment manufacturer.
			2. The Verticel equipment manufacturer must coordinate with the Systems Integrator during programming development, equipment fabrication, pre-commissioning testing, and startup to deliver an approved working system.
			3. Submit coordination copies of the software as required in the Submittals article of this specification.
			4. Fully document the final PLC software program including initial set points as required under the Submittals article of this specification
			5. The PLC program shall perform the necessary logic functions (including all process functions, PID loops, interlocks, alarm functions, motor controls, and communications) to monitor and control the equipment, monitor the associated instrumentation, and communicate with the plant wide controls system as described below and as necessary for a complete and fully functioning system.
			6. Program the PLC to process the inputs, outputs, and alarms associated with that PLC as illustrated on the P&IDs. The communications protocol is described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System.
			7. Fully test and commission the PLC programming through interactive simulation prior to shipping.
			8. The graphical Operator Interface (OI) described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System, will provide for remote monitoring and control of the field devices. The graphical OI is not in the Verticel equipment manufacturer’s scope.
			9. The graphical OI will include graphics shown on the P&IDs and as defined in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System. The PLC provided by the Verticel equipment
   1. manufacturer shall provide the graphical OI with inputs and outputs as shown on the P&IDs and as described in the Section 409423 Supervisory Control System.

* 
	+ 
		- 
			1. The graphical OI will provide alarm and alarm acknowledge function descriptions as described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System. The PLC provided by the Verticel equipment manufacturer shall provide alarm outputs as shown on the P&IDs and as listed in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System.
			2. The graphical OI will provide for the remote input of set points into the PLC from the graphical OI. The Verticel equipment manufacturer shall provide for Inputs from the graphical OI for all Operator Adjustable set points in the PLC. The Set Points screen in the graphical OI is described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System. Set points include–but are not limited to–analytical values, levels, timers, and flows.
			3. The software tagging convention for control devices is described in Section 409423 Supervisory Control System and shall be followed explicitly by the Verticel equipment manufacturer in setting up and programming the PLC unless specifically approved in writing by the Systems Integrator and the Engineer.
			4. Special Alarms/Functions
				1. The PLC provided by the Verticel manufacturer shall continuously monitor the status of each piece of equipment and continuously compare that status to the current command for that equipment (either a PLC generated command or an operator command from the OI). If the equipment status does not agree with the PLC command (e.g. a pump commanded to run is not running or a valve commanded to close is not closed) the PLC shall generate a “Fault Logic Disagreement” alarm. This alarm shall be communicated to the OI.
				2. For gates or valves, the “Fault Logic Disagreement” alarm shall be delayed for 120 seconds after a change in status to allow valves to fully open or close. For pumps, the “Fault Logic Disagreement” alarm shall be delayed for 10 seconds after a change in status to allow pumps to start or stop.
				3. The PLC shall monitor GNRLFLT3 on the SCADA system and shall provide necessary output to a yellow strobe during conditions of a general fault via interposing relay.

		1. Functional Description
   1. The following is a general description of the equipment functions. Complete and detailed functions and logic are to be provided by the Verticel equipment manufacturer. All process set points shall be operator adjustable from the OI. The Verticel manufacturer shall provide initial factory settings of set points based on the specific conditions of this project or “typical” settings if specifics do not apply.

*

		- 
			1. Operating Modes
   1. In this description, hardware functions, such as field hand switches, are referred to as “hard” (e.g. hard switch); software functions performed at the OI are referred to as “soft” (e.g. soft switch). Regardless of the mode of operation (described below) process indications will remain active (these may include valve position, motor on or off, VFD speed, process flow measurements, etc) and hard wired alarms and safeties (such as motor overloads or high temperature, etc) will be active and reported by the PLC.

* 
	+ 
		- 
			* 
				1. HAND OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the HAND position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall run and the system controls shall not control the device.
				2. LOCAL OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the LOCAL position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment is controlled locally by hard switches, which may include on-off, open-close, etc. and the system controls shall not control the equipment.
				3. OFF POSITION (Hard Switch): When the OFF position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall stop and the system controls shall not control the device.
				4. AUTO OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment shall be controlled automatically by the controls system.
				5. REMOTE OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the REMOTE position is selected at the hard switch the equipment will be controlled automatically by the controls system.
				6. AUTO OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the OI soft switch, the system automatic controls (logic) are enabled and the manual soft switches are disabled (these may include on-off, open close, etc).
				7. MANUAL OPERATION (Soft Switch): When the MANUAL position is selected at the OI soft switch, the manual soft controls are enabled (these may include on- off, open close, etc) and the system automatic controls (logic) are disabled
				8. EMERGENCY STOP (Hard Switch): Equipment can be deactivated at any time by pressing the EMERGENCY STOP push button (where present). The EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton overrides all other controls including remote or automatic controls and the hard HOA switch. EMERGENCY STOP pushbuttons shall be hardwired into the motor starting control circuitry, as shown on the schematics found in the Electrical drawings. For equipment where schematics have not been provided on the contract drawings, integration of hardwire EMERGENCY STOP control shall be included. EMERGENCY STOP push buttons must be manually reset to allow the equipment to run.
			1. VCR
				1. The system shall be designed to monitor ORP in the VLR Tanks and DO in fine bubble aeration tanks to control the rate of oxygen delivery to each tank (through disc aerator speed and blower operation) based on the ORP and DO and the process objectives.
				2. Suspended solids shall be measured in the mixed liquor and the Final Clarifier sludge (RAS). The waste activated sludge discharge to the existing plant shall be controlled by the WAS pumps to maintain an operator-selected sludge age. Sludge discharge will be coordinated with the main PLC functions to optimize VCR system.
				3. Plant flow shall be monitored and the point of application of the influent shall be adjusted by operating the VCR Inlet and RAS Inlet gates during high flow events to enter the Stormflow mode of operation and prevent solids loss in the clarifiers. A “Total Influent Flow” signal from the “Influent Pumps Controller” is input from the SCADA network.
			2. Blowers
				1. Blowers will be run as required to maintain the required ORP or DO. The air inlet valve to a VLR will be opened when blower air is required for the VLR cell (the valve will be closed when blower air is no longer required), and the air inlet valves to a fine bubble aeration basin will be modulated to maintain adequate DO in the fine bubble aeration basin..
				2. There is a pressure monitor in the blower discharge manifold and the blower inlet lines have automatic modulating valves. Four of the five blowers have sufficient capacity to supply air to all the VLR and fine bubble aeration basins. The VCR
   1. controller will operate the number of blowers and modulate the inlet valves based on the amount of air required.

*

		- 
			1. Primary Clarifiers
				1. Primary clarifiers will run based on operator input from the OI.
			2. Primary Sludge Pumps
				1. Primary Sludge Pumps will run based upon a time setpoint (operator settable).
				2. Only one Primary Sludge Pump shall run at any given time.
			3. Final Clarifiers
				1. Final clarifiers will run based on operator input from the OI.
			4. Sludge Pumps
				1. The speed of the RAS pumps will be controlled to maintain an operator- selected flow set point. One of the two WAS pumps will be turned on or off to maintain an operator-selected sludge age (mean call residence time) set point. The WAS pumps shall be interlocked with the RAS pumps such that the WAS pumps will not operate unless one of the RAS pumps is running.
				2. The VCR Controller shall receive an input from the OI to allow the Operator to select which three of the five RAS Pumps and which one of the two WAS Pumps to run. The PLC shall direct control signals to the selected pumps and disable controls to the de-selected pumps.
   1. Execution

	1. INSTALLATION
		1. The Contractor shall install the Verticel System as shown on the drawings.
		2. Equipment shall be installed in accordance with general mechanical requirements and in accordance with the Manufacturer's recommendations to provide a complete installation.
		3. The Contractor shall level/align shafts and install drives, aeration discs and weatherhoods in accordance with the Manufacturer's drawings and installation manual.
		4. Prior to connecting the diffuser elements to the headers the Contractor shall carefully clean all piping, headers, and accessories through which air is delivered so all dust, dirt, oil, grease, or other foreign material will be effectively removed from contact with the air being blown through the diffusers. This cleaning shall be done with air at a velocity of 2,000 to 3,000 feet per minute. All diffusers shall be leveled to within 3/8 inch of a common horizontal plane.
	2. FIELD TESTING
		1. After the piping, headers and diffusers for any tank have been installed, clear water shall be introduced into the tank until the diffusers have been covered about 2 inches. Compressed air shall then be released through the piping and any leaks (through joints, piping and the like) shall
   1. be repaired. This test shall be repeated until the entire system is air tight to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Testing will be done by the Contractor under the direction of the Engineer.

*
