1. INSTALLATION
   1. Install insulation, jackets and accessories in accordance with manufacturers instructions and under ambient temperatures and conditions recommended by manufacturer. Surfaces to be insulated must be clean and dry. 
   1. Do not insulate systems or equipment which are specified to be pressure tested or inspected, until testing, inspection and any necessary repairs have been successfully completed.
   1. Install insulation with smooth and even surfaces. Poorly fitted joints or use of filler in voids will not be accepted. Provide neatly beveled and coated terminations at all nameplates, uninsulated fittings, or at other locations where insulation terminates. 
   1. Use full length material (as delivered from manufacturer) wherever possible. Scrap piecing of insulation or pieces cut undersize and stretched to fit will not be accepted. 
1. PIPING, VALVE, AND FITTING INSULATION

General
:
      1. Install insulation with butt joints and longitudinal seams closed tightly. Secure with staples along seams and butt joints. 
   1. Install insulation continuous through supports on the exterior of insulation. 
   1. Insulation Inserts and Pipe Shields:
      1. Provide insulation inserts and pipe shields at all support locations as applicable for associated utility system. Inserts may be omitted on 3/4” and smaller copper piping provided 12” long 22 gauge pipe shields are used.
   1. Fittings and Valves:
      1. Fittings, valves, unions, flanges, couplings and specialties may be insulated with factory molded or built up insulation of the same thickness as adjoining insulation. 
   1. Mineral Fiber:
      1. Secure each 3’ section with three stainless steel bands evenly spaced and at ends. Snip off excess and turn ends over into insulation. Stagger joints where more than one layer is used.
   1. Elastomeric and Polyolefin:
      1. Where practical, slip insulation on piping during pipe installation when pipe ends are open. Miter cut fittings allowing sufficient length to prevent stretching. Completely seal seams and joints for vapor tight installation. For elastomeric insulation, apply full bed of adhesive to both surfaces. For polyeolefin, seal factory preglued seams with roller and field seams and joints with full bed of hot melt polyolefin glue to both surfaces. Cover elastomeric insulation on systems operating below 40 degrees F with vapor barrier mastic.
   1. EXTRUDED POLYSTYRENE AND POLYISOCYANURATE:
      1. Secure insulation sections with two wraps of nylon filament tape 9”-12” on center. On single insulation layer systems and on the outer layer of double insulation layer systems, apply a thin coat of elastomeric joint sealant rated for system operating temperatures to all longitudinal and butt insulation joints covering entire face of joint. Allow sealant to fully cure before applying protective covering. Fill voids in factory molded or built-up valve and fitting insulation with foamed in place urethane insulation. Apply vapor stop bead of joint sealant between pipe and insulation on both sides of valves, expansion/contraction joints, flanges, and attached vent and drain lines. 
1. *Protective jackets are required for exterior installations and where insulation is subject to physical abuse.*** 
   1. Protective Jackets:
      1. See associated underground utility piping specification. ***Reference section.*
1. Make sure that the utility piping specification, e.g., chilled water, steam/condensate or hot water, adequately covers this underground piping insulation/and piping covering and corrosion protection requirements .
   1. Pipe Insulation Schedule:
      1. Provide insulation on new and existing remodeled piping as indicated in the following schedule:
         1. *Where asbestos abatement activities require reinsulation of existing piping not remodeled, expand above description to clarify scope of insulation work.*
1. *More than one insulation type can be listed for a given service if appropriate. Where insulation conductivity significantly differs from schedule, reference Comm 63.29, Appendix A to determine appropriate thickness. Coordinate insulation entries with associated underground piping utility section.*
