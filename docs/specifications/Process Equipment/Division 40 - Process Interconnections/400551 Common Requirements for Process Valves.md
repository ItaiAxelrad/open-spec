2. Painting Requirements:
      1. Comply with Specification Section 09 90 00 for painting and protective coatings.

5. For threaded valves, provide union on one (1) side within 2 FT of valve to allow valve removal.
6. Install valves accessible for operation, inspection, and maintenance.
7. For the filter valve replacement, it is the Contractor’s responsibility to confirm the lay length of the existing valves as it pertains to their ability to do the work.
8. For the filter valve electric actuator replacement, it is the Contractor’s responsibility to confirm the shaft size and torque requirements of the existing valves.
	1. **Adjustment
9. For all electric actuators, employ and pay for services of valve actuator manufacturer's field service representative to:
	1. Inspect valve actuators covered by this Specification Section.
	2. Supervise adjustments and installation checks:
		1. Open and close valves electrically under local manual and demonstrate that all limit switches are properly adjusted and that switch contacts are functioning properly by verifying the inputs are received at the remote input/output (RIO) panels or local control panel as appropriate.
		2. Position modulating valves electrically under local manual control and demonstrate that the valve position feedback potentiometer is properly adjusted and that the feedback signal is received at the RIO panels or local control panel as appropriate.
		3. Simulate a valve position command signal at the RIO panel or local control panel as appropriate and demonstrate that the valve is controlled to the desired position without excessive hunting.
	3. Provide Owner with a written statement that the valve actuator manufacturer has verified that the actuators have been installed properly, that all limit switches and position potentiometers have been properly adjusted and that the valve actuator responds correctly to the valve position command.
