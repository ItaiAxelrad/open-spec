2. PIPING SYSTEM
   1. The pipe shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D3754 – Standard Specification for
Fiberglass (Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Thermosetting-Resin) Sewer and Industrial Pressure Pipe.
   1. The pipe shall meet the following conditions:
      1. Pipe inside diameter:
         1. 48 inches
   1. Working pressure:
      1. 10 psi
   1. Test pressure:
      1. 20 psi
   1. Earth load:
      1. 3 ft to 15 ft.
   1. Live load:
      1. H-20 loading
3. MATERIALS
   1. Resin Systems – The manufacturer shall use only polyester resin systems with a proven history
of performance in this particular application. The historical data shall have been acquired from a
   1. composite material of similar construction and composition as the proposed product.
   1. Glass Reinforcements – The reinforcing glass fibers used to manufacture the components shall
be of highest quality commercial grad E-glass filaments with binder and sizing compatible with
   1. impregnating resins.
   1. Silica Sand – Sand shall be minimum 98% silica with a maximum moisture content of 0.2%.
   1. Additives – Resin additives, such as curing agents, pigments, dyes, fillers, thixotropic agents,
etc., when used, shall not detrimentally affect the performance of the product.
   1. Elastomeric Gaskets – Gaskets shall meet ASTM F477 and be supplied by qualified gasket
manufacturers and be suitable for the service intended.
4. MANUFACTURE AND CONSTRUCTION
   1. Pipes – Manufacture pipe by the centrifugal casting on filament wound process to result in a
dense, nonporous, corrosion-resistant, consistent composite structure. The pipe nominal
   1. pressure class shall be minimum PN 25. The maximum transient (operating plus surge) pressure
   1. of the line shall not exceed the pipe nominal pressure class by more than 40%.
   1. Joints – The pipe shall be field connected with fiberglass sleeve coupling that utilize elastomeric
sealing gaskets as the sole means to maintain joint water tightness. The joints must meet the
   1. performance requirements of ASTM D4161. Tie-ins, when needed, may utilize gasket-sealed
   1. mechanical couplings.
   1. Fittings – Flanges, elbows, reducers, tees, wyes, laterals, and other fittings shall be capable of
withstanding all operating conditions when installed. They may be contact molded or
   1. manufactured from mitered sections of pipe joined by glass- fiber- reinforced overlays. Properly
   1. protected standard ductile iron, fusion-bonded epoxy-coated steel and stainless steel fittings
   1. may also be used. Unbalanced thrust forces shall be restrained with thrust blocks or other
   1. suitable methods. Fiberglass tees, wyes, laterals, or other similar fittings shall be fully encased
   1. in reinforced concrete designed to withstand the pressure forces.
5. DIMENSIONS
   1. Diameters – The actual outside diameter (18" to 48") of the pipes shall be in accordance with
AWWA C950. For other diameters, ODs shall be per manufacturer’s literature.
   1. Lengths – Pipe shall be supplied in nominal lengths of 20 feet. Actual laying length shall be
nominal +1, -4 inches. At least 90% of the total footage of each size and class of pipe, excluding
   1. special order lengths, shall be furnished in nominal length sections.
   1. Wall Thickness – The minimum wall thickness shall be the stated design thickness.
   1. End Squareness – Pipe ends shall be square to the pipe axis with a maximum tolerance of 1/8".
6. TESTING
   1. Pipes – Pipes shall be manufactured in accordance with the applicable standard.
   1. Joints – Coupling joints shall meet the requirements of ASTM D4161.
   1. Stiffness – Minimum pipe stiffness when tested in accordance with ASTM D2412 shall be
minimum 36 psi.
   1. Tensile Strength – Pipe hoop tensile strength for pressure pipe shall be verified as specified in
applicable standard (ASTM D3754 or AWWA C950) or by random burst testing at the same
   1. sampling frequency. All pipes shall be capable of withstanding a test pressure of two (2) times
   1. the maximum sustained operating pressure of the line without leaking or cracking. This
   1. performance shall be verified as agreed between the buyer and seller.
7. CUSTOMER INSPECTION
   1. The Owner or other designated representative shall be entitled to inspect pipes or witness the
pipe manufacturing.
   1. Manufacturer’s Notification to Customer – Should the Owner request to see specific pipes
during any phase of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer must provide the Owner with
   1. adequate advance notice of when and where the production of those pipes will take place.
   1. Execution
1. INSTALLATION
   1. The installation of pipe and fittings shall be in accordance with the project plans and
specifications and the manufacturer’s requirements.
2. PIPE HANDLING
   1. Use textile slings, other suitable materials, or a forklift. Use of chains or cables is not allowed.
3. JOINTING
   1. Clean ends of pipe and coupling components
   1. Apply joint lubricant to pipe ends and the elastomeric seals of coupling. Use only lubricants
approved by the pipe manufacturer.
   1. Use suitable equipment and end protection to push or pull the pipes together.
   1. Do not exceed forces recommended by the manufacturer for coupling pipe.
   1. Join pipes in straight alignment then deflect to required angle. Do not allow the deflection angle
to exceed the deflection permitted by the manufacturer.
4. FIELD TESTS
   1. Pressure Test – Pressure pipes may be field tested after completion of the installation (including
required thrust restraints) at a maximum pressure of 20 psi. Prior to testing, assure that all work
   1. has been properly completed.
   1. When filling the line assure that all air is expelled to avoid dangerous build-up of compressed
air potential energy. Pressurize the line slowly, so pressure surges exceeding test pressures are
   1. not developed. Check for leaks when the test pressure has stabilized.
