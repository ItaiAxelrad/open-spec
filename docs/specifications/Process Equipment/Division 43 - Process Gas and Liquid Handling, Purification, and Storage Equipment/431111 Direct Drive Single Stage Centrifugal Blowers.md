		1. Operational Modes
			1. In this description, hardware functions, such as field hand switches, are referred to as “hard” (e.g. hard switch); software functions performed at the OI are referred to as “soft” (e.g. soft switch). Regardless of the mode of operation (described below) process indications will remain active (these may include valve position, motor on or off, VFD speed, process flow measurements, etc) and hard wired alarms and safeties (such as motor overloads or high temperature, etc) will be active and reported by the PLC.
				1. HAND OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the HAND position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall run and the system controls shall not control the device.
				2. OFF POSITION (Hard Switch): When the OFF position is selected at the hard switch, the associated equipment shall stop and the system controls shall not control the device.
				3. AUTO OPERATION (Hard Switch): When the AUTO position is selected at the hard switch, the equipment shall be controlled automatically by the controls system.
				4. EMERGENCY STOP (Hard Switch): Equipment can be deactivated at any time by pressing the EMERGENCY STOP push button (where present). The EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton overrides all other controls including remote or automatic controls and the hard HOA switch. EMERGENCY STOP pushbuttons shall be hardwired into the motor starting control circuitry, as shown on the schematics found in the Electrical drawings. For equipment where schematics have not been provided on the contract drawings, integration of hardwire EMERGENCY STOP control shall be included. EMERGENCY STOP push buttons must be manually reset to allow the equipment to run.
		2. Motor Overload Protection
			1. The panel shall include a solid state meter with a digital read out to indicate motor amperage as well as air flow on the panel front. An adjustable set point switch shall be incorporated to provide a warning of high amperage. A second adjustable set point switch shall open a set of contacts that will cause the motor to shut down when the amperage draw reaches the motor’s FLA. Two lights shall be provided to indicate impending high amperage and high amperage trip. A reset pushbutton shall be provided that must be pressed before the motor can be restarted following an overpower trip. An adjustable 0 to 30-second time delay relay shall be incorporated in the circuitry to prevent a motor overload trip while the motor is being started. A suitable current transformer for the ammeter shall be provided by the blower manufacturer and installed in the motor starter enclosure. The ammeter shall hold and indicate the last amperage reading at the time of an overload trip.
		3. Blower Surge Protection
			1. The solid state ammeter shall include adjustable switches to alarm impending surge and to trip the blower motor at the blower surge set point. Two lights shall be provided to indicate impending surge and surge trip. A reset pushbutton shall be provided that must be pressed before the motor can be restarted following a surge trip. An adjustable 0 to 30-second time delay relay shall be provided to prevent a transitory surge trip.
	1. SURFACE PREPARATION AND SHOP PAINTING
		1. All surfaces, except aluminum and stainless steel, shall be prepared, shop primed and shop finish painted with two finish coats of Manufacturer’s standard paint system
		2. Machine surfaces that are not painted shall be protected by coating with a corrosive-protective compound.
	2. PERFORMANCE TESTING
		1. Each blower shall be tested at the manufacturer’s facility to determine that vibration and bearing temperature levels are within specified tolerances. Each blower shall be operated until it reaches a sustained temperature before measurements are recorded.
		2. ASME performance tests are not required for compressors built of parts cast in patterns from which previous units have been cast, built and tested. Performance for untested blowers shall be guaranteed by the manufacturer to be within performance allowances on the predicted blower performance curves.
