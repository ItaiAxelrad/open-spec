2. Bowl assembly
	1. The bowls shall be flanged type constructed of close-grained cast iron conform to ASTM A48, class 30. 
	2. They shall be free from sand holes, blowholes, or other faults and must be accurately machined and fitted to close tolerances.
	3. They shall be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic pressure equal to twice the pressure at rated flow or 1.5 times shut-off head, whichever is greater. 
	4. The intermediate bowls shall have enamel or epoxy lined waterways for maximum efficiency and wear protection. 
	5. All intermediate bowls shall be of identical design for interchangeability. 
	6. All the bowls shall be fitted with sleeve type bearings of bronze alloy C89835. 
	7. A discharge bowl shall be used to connect bowl assembly to the discharge pipe. 
	8. An extra-long bronze bearing packed with non-soluble grease shall be provided in the top bowl and extended into the discharge bowl.
	9. The bearing shall have a threaded cast iron cap or plug at the top to protect the bearing from abrasives. 
	10. The hub of the discharge bowl should be such that the bearing can be easily removed through the top of the hub. A thrust ring shall be above the top impeller to prevent excessive vertical up thrust.
3. Impeller
	1. The impellers shall be constructed from ASTM B584 Silicon Bronze and shall be the enclosed type. 
	2. They shall be free from defects and must be accurately cast, machined, balanced, and filed for optimum performance and minimum vibration. 
	3. Impellers shall be balanced to grade G6.3 of ISO 1940 as minimum. 
	4. They shall be securely fastened to the bowl shaft with taper locks of C1018.
4. Corrosion Protection
	1. The pump/motor shaft wetted-end shall be series 300 stainless steel. 
	2. Both inner and outer surfaces of cast iron shall be electrocoat-painted with thermo-setting Acrylic baked at 400ยบ F., after castings are completely machined. 
	3. The gland nut/strain reliefs shall be series 300 stainless steel.
5. Motor 
	1. The motor shall be a heavy duty canned (or wet wound) type of NEMA design 3600 RPM. 
	2. The motor shall be capable of continuous operation under water at the specified conditions outlined above. 
	3. A suitable thrust bearing shall be incorporated in the lower end of the motor adequate to receive the entire hydraulic thrust load of the pump unit plus the weight of the rotating parts regardless of the direction of rotation. 
	4. The motor shall have a 1.15 service factor, and suitable for use on 460-volt, three phase, 60 Hz electric service. 
	5. The motor leads shall be of sufficient length so that they may be spliced above the bowl assembly and the leads shall be protected by a type 304 stainless steel cable guard held in place with stainless steel banding.

	2. It shall be precision ground and polished with surface finish better than 40 RMS.
10. Coupling
	1. The shaft coupling shall be of stainless steel and be capable of transmitting the total torque and total thrust of the bowl assembly in either direction of rotation.
11. Motor Adapter
	1. The inlet motor adapter shall be of ASTM A536 Gr. 60-40-18 ductile iron and shall contain an extra-long bronze bearing.
