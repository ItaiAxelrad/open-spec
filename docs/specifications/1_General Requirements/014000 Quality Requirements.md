   1. Testing and inspecting services are required to verify compliance with requirements specified or
      1. These services do not relieve Contractor of responsibility for compliance with the Contract Document requirements.
3. Specific quality-control requirements for individual construction activities are specified
   1. in the Sections that specify those activities. Requirements in those Sections may also
   1. cover production of standard products.
4. Specified tests, inspections, and related actions do not limit Contractor's quality-control
   1. procedures that facilitate compliance with the Contract Document requirements.
5. Requirements for Contractor to provide quality-control services required by Engineer,
   1. Owner, or authorities having jurisdiction are not limited by provisions of this Section.
   1. Related Sections include the following:

      1. Services do not include contract enforcement activities performed by Engineer.
   1. Mockups:
      1. Full-size, physical assemblies that are constructed on-site. Mockups are used to verify selections made under sample submittals, to demonstrate aesthetic effects and, where

   1. or operation; they are not Samples.
   1. Preconstruction Testing:
      1. Tests and inspections that are performed specifically for the Project before products and materials are incorporated into the Work to verify performance or

   1. Field Quality-Control Testing:
      1. Tests and inspections that are performed on-site for installation of the Work and for completed Work.
   1. Testing Agency:
      1. An entity engaged to perform specific tests, inspections, or both. Testing laboratory shall mean the same as testing agency.
   1. Installer/Applicator/Erector:
