Failure to observe or notify by the Owner does not relieve the Contractor of compliance with Contract Documents.
   20. Product Data
   21. Submit within 20 working days after Award of Contract
   22. Collect Product Data into a single submittal for each element of construction or system. Product Data includes printed information, such as manufacturer's installation instructions, catalog cuts, standard color charts, roughing-in diagrams and templates, standard wiring diagrams, and performance curves.
