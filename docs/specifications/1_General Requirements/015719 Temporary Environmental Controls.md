   1. Temporary Environmental Controls

## General

1. SUMMARY
   1. Section Includes:
	1. Minimizing the pollution of water or land; control of noise, the disposal of solid waste materials, and protection of deposits of historical or archaeological interest.
	2. Quality Assurance
2. The Contractor shall comply with the requirements of the Colorado “Water Quality Control Act” and amendments thereto, Article 8 of Chapter 25, CRS 1973 and all rules and regulations adopted thereunder as well as the requirements of this section.
	1. Submittals
3. Shop Drawings:
	1. Prior to the start of any construction activities submit:
		1. A detailed proposal of all methods of control and preventive measures to be utilized for environmental protection.
		2. A drawing of the work area, haul routes, storage areas, access routes and current land conditions including trees and vegetation.
		3. A copy of the NPDES permit for storm water discharges from construction activities.
		4. A copy of the approved pollution prevention plan.
## Product
1. 2.1 Water Impoundment Fence Material
   1. Temporary water impoundments shall be constructed using Envirofence 100% as manufactured by MIRAFI, Inc. or by using hay bales securely anchored with metal posts, or a combination of both.
1. 2.2 Mulch and Seed
   1. All revegetation shall be in accordance with requirements of Section 32 90 00.

## Execution

1. 3.1 Installation
   1. Employ and utilize environmental protection methods, obtain all necessary permits, and fully observe all local, state, and federal regulations.
2. Land Protection:
	1. Except for any work or storage area and access routes specifically assigned for the use of the Contractor, the land areas outside the limits of construction shall be preserved in their present condition.
		1. Contractor shall confine his construction activities to areas defined for work within the Contract Documents.
	2. Manage and control all borrow areas, work or storage areas, access routes and embankments to prevent sediment from entering nearby water or land adjacent to the work site.
	3. Restore all disturbed areas including borrow and haul areas and establish permanent type of locally adaptable vegetative cover.
	4. Unless earthwork is immediately paved or surfaced, protect all side slopes and backslopes immediately upon completion of final grading.
	5. Plan and execute earthwork in a manner to minimize duration of exposure of unprotected soils.
	6. Except for areas designated by the Contract Documents to be cleared and grubbed, the Contractor shall not deface, injure or destroy trees and vegetation, nor remove, cut, or disturb them without approval of the Engineer.
		1. Any damage caused by the Contractor's equipment or operations shall be restored as nearly as possible to its original condition at the Contractor's expense.
3. Surface Water Protection:
	1. In general, all construction activities shall proceed in such a manner so as not to pollute any watercourse, water body, conduit carry water, etc., all in accordance with this specification and to the satisfaction of the Engineer. 
		1. The Engineer may direct the Contractor to provide immediate temporary pollution or erosion control measures to prevent contamination of adjacent streams, other watercourses, or impoundments.
	2. The Contractor shall be responsible for limiting the surface area of earth materials exposed by construction methods
		1. To immediately provide permanent and temporary pollution control measures to prevent contamination of adjacent watercourses and water bodies
		2. To minimize erosion of the site and abutting property.
	3. All slopes of stockpiled and excavated materials, all borrow stored on the site, all embankments and/or filling operations sloping into or near watercourses, water bodies, wetlands, etc., and all other disturbed area shall be protected with mulching, seeding or silt control fences. 
		1. A temporary system of anchored bales of hay or straw or Envirofence shall be placed at or near the toe of all exposed earth surfaces with a gradient of 25 percent or greater, around the perimeter of the work area and at other locations as the Engineer may direct, until such areas are reduced in grade or permanently stabilized.
	4. The Engineer has the authority to direct the Contractor to divert surface water runoff away from exposed raw earth surfaces through the use of temporary berms, dikes, dams, and diversion channels as considered appropriate.
	5. The Contractor shall be responsible for the preservation of all stream banks within and adjacent to the limits of work. 
		1. No excavation, stockpiling, or construction equipment will be permitted within 10-feet of the top of any stream bank or water body, unless required for the work shown on the Drawings. 
		2. Any stream bank disturbed by the contractor’s operations will be rip rapped or otherwise repaired as ordered by the Engineer.
4. Solid Waste Disposal:
	1. Collect solid waste on a daily basis.
	2. Provide disposal of degradable solid waste to an approved solid waste disposal site.
	3. Provide disposal of nondegradable solid waste to an approved solid waste disposal site or in an alternate manner approved by Engineer and regulatory agencies.
	4. No building materials wastes or unused building materials shall be buried, dumped, or disposed of on the site.
5. Fuel and Chemical Handling:
	1. Store and dispose of chemical wastes in a manner approved by regulatory agencies.
	2. Take special measures to prevent chemicals, fuels, oils, greases, herbicides, and insecticides from entering drainage ways.
	3. Do not allow water used in onsite material processing, concrete curing, cleanup, and other waste waters to enter a drainage way(s) or stream.
	4. The Contractor shall provide containment around fueling and chemical storage areas to ensure that spills in these areas do not reach waters of the state.
6. Burning:
	1. Do not burn material on the site.
	2. If the Contractor elects to dispose of waste materials by 1 burning, make arrangements for an off-site burning area and conform to all agency regulations.
7. Control of Noise:
	1. Control noise by fitting equipment with appropriate mufflers.
8. Completion of Work:
	1. Upon completion of work, leave area in a clean, natural looking condition.
	2. Ensure all signs of temporary construction and activities incidental to construction of required permanent work are removed.
	3. Grade, fill and seed all disturbed areas.
9. Historical Protection:
	1. If during the course of construction, evidence of deposits of historical or archaeological interests is found, cease work affecting find and notify Engineer.
		1. Do not disturb deposits until written notice from Engineer is given to proceed.
	2. The Contractor will be compensated for lost time or changes in construction to avoid the find based upon normal change order procedures.
