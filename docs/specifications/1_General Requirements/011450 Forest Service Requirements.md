   1. For the purpose of fighting forest fires on or in the vicinity of the project which are not caused by the Contractor or the Contractor's employees and when requested by the Contracting Officer, place the Contractor's employees and equipment temporarily at the disposal of the Forest Service.
   2. Payment for such services will be made by the Government at not less than the current rate for firefighting services established by the Forest Service in the area concerned.
   3. Any employees and equipment furnished will be relieved from firefighting as soon as the Forest Service finds that it is practicable to employ other labor and equipment adequate for the protection of the area.
   4. An equitable adjustment in contract time will be made for this period.

Except for those access roads and borrow areas specifically covered in these specifications, approval of the Contracting Officer must be obtained in advance before locating additional access roads or borrow areas on national forest land.

      4. After the pit has been graded and properly sloped, evenly spread the stored topsoil over the subsoil exposed by the excavation.
      5. Dispose of materials unsuitable for construction purposes as directed by the Contracting Officer.
