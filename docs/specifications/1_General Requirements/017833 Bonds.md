   1. Disclaimers and Limitations:
      1. Manufacturer's disclaimers and limitations on product warranties

   1. warranties with the Contractor.
3. DEFINITIONS
   1. Standard Product Warranties are preprinted written warranties published by individual
manufacturers for particular products and are specifically endorsed by the manufacturer to the
   1. Owner.
   1. Special Warranties are written warranties required by or incorporated in the Contract
Documents, either to extend time limits provided by standard warranties to provide greater
   1. rights for the Owner.
4. WARRANTY REQUIREMENTS
   1. Related Damages and Losses:
      1. When correcting warranted Work that has failed, remove and
replace other Work that has been damaged as a result of such failure or that must be removed
   1. and replaced to provide access for correction of warranted Work.
   1. Reinstatement of Warranty:

rebuild the Work to an acceptable condition complying with requirements of Contract

   1. regardless of whether the Owner has benefited from us of the Work through a portion of its
   1. anticipated useful service life.
   1. Owner's Recourse:
      1. Written warranties made to the Owner are in addition to implied warranties,
and shall not limit the duties, obligations, rights and remedies otherwise available under the law,
   1. nor shall warranty periods be interpreted as limitations on time in which the Owner can enforce
   1. such other duties, obligations, rights, or remedies.
1. Rejection of Warranties:
      1. The Owner reserves the right to reject warranties and to limit
   1. selections to products with warranties not in conflict with requirements of the Contract
   1. Documents.
   1. The Owner reserves the right to refuse to accept Work for the Project where a special warranty,
