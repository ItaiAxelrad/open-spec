   1. Top Rails
   1. 31-mm (1-1/4-inch) steel pipe, furnished in random lengths of approximately 6 meters (20 feet) and jointed with expansion couplings of special design for fence work.

   1. Execution

General
   1. Comply with ASTM F567, unless otherwise specified.
   1. installation
   1. Laying Out Work
   1. Set fence posts parallel to and inside the property line in such a manner that no part of the fencing occurs over the property line.
   1. Post Foundations
   1. Excavate for foundations as required to form the concrete, with bottoms clean and clear of loose material and water before concrete is placed. Remove excess excavated material from the site.
   1. Minimum size:
      1. 3 times post diameter by 990 mm (39 inches) deep. Minimum post embedment in concrete:
      1. 910 (36 inches), unless otherwise indicated. Extend top of concrete foundations approximately 25 mm (one inch) above finish grade, sloping away from the posts, and finished smooth and even.
   1. Tamp concrete solidly into the excavations and around posts. Allow concrete to cure at least 4 days before erecting fabric.
   1. Fencing
   1. Erect fencing in accordance with manufacturer's instructions and approved Shop Drawings. Erect Work in a rigid and substantial manner. Set posts plumb in each direction and in alignment.
   1. Stretch fabric with standard stretching equipment at maximum intervals of 30 meters (100 feet) and tie securely with fabric on outside of line posts. Attach fabric with wire ties at maximum spacing of 350 mm (14 inches) to line posts and 600 mm (24 inches) to top rails. Attach fabric to tubular terminal, corner and gate posts with stretcher bars threaded through fabric and attached to posts with pressed steel bands at 380-mm (15-inch) maximum spacing. Make splices by interweaving the fabric and not by terminating the fabric at a line post.
   1. Gates
   1. Install gates plumb, level and secure for full opening without interference. Adjust hardware for smooth operation.
   1. Provide ground set stops and pipe guides for sliding gates.
   1. Provide ground set plunger rod catch for double-leaf swinging gates.
   1. Embed ground set items in concrete foundation.
   1. Bottom Tension Wire
   1. Provide a 4.50-mm (7 gage) galvanized or aluminum-coated spring steel tension wire near the bottom of the fence fabric, attached to the fabric at 600-mm (2-foot) intervals with 2.51-mm (12-1/2) gage galvanized hog rings.
   1. Pea Gravel
   1. Place pea gravel under and adjacent to the fence as indicated.
