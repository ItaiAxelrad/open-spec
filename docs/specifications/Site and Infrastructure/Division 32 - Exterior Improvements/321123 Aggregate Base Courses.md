   1. Cement-Treated Base Course
   1. Uniformly mix, moisten, compact, finish, and cure the soil and portland cement as specified, conforming to the lines, grades, thickness and cross-section indicated.
   1. Equipment
   1. Provide equipment at the site which is suitable in capacity and quantity for accomplishing the Work including stabilizers, pulverizers, graders, spreaders, compactors, water trucks, and the following:
      1. Segmented wheel rollers weighing 7 to 9 metric tons (8 to 10 tons) and between 3.6 and 5.8 kg per mm (200 and 325 pounds per inch) width of roller.
   1. A vibratory pad type vibrator, such as the Jackson Multiple Vibrator.
   1. A wobble-wheel pneumatic tired roller developing a compression of not less than 39.4 N per mm (225 pounds per inch) of tire width.
   1. The equipment used for wetting the finished base course and for applying the cure coat shall not cause marring or rutting of the surface.
   1. Subgrade Preparation
   1. Clean rough graded areas of foreign substances and inspect the areas by proof rolling. Rework areas having inadequate compaction, unstable material or deviations from surface tolerances, in the judgment of the Architect, to comply with requirements of Section 02210.
   1. Compaction
   1. Compact the mixture with a segmented roller or other equipment capable of compacting the entire layer to required density, and then blade, level and compact with a vibratory pad compactor. Give the top layer a final rolling with a wobble-wheel pneumatic-tired roller.
   1. Compact each layer to not less than 100 percent of maximum density at optimum moisture content. If field tests indicate that a layer is not compacted to the required density, additional wetting, not to exceed optimum moisture content as determined by ASTM D558, Method B, if necessary, and rolling is required or removal and replacement is required, unless core tests show that the required 7 day compressive strength is obtained.
   1. Finished Grade and Thickness
   1. Bring the top surface of base course, after compaction, to or slightly above finish grade and bring to finish grade by removing excess material, followed by recompaction and rolling. Rake low areas to a depth not exceeding 25 mm (1 inch), dampen with water, fill with additional mixture applied to damp surface, and then roll.
   1. Provide a total thickness of finished base course of within 13 mm (1/2 inch) of the required thickness.
   1. Cure Coat
   1. Maintain completed base course in a continuously moist condition, free of loose and extraneous material until application of cure coat. Apply cure coat, as soon as possible, the same day the base course is constructed.
   1. Apply bituminous material uniformly to the surface of base course by a pressure distributor to produce complete coverage without excessive runoff and at a minimum rate of 0.68 liters per square meter (0.15 gallons per square yard).
   1. Should it be necessary for construction equipment to use the cure coated base course before the bituminous material has hardened enough to prevent pickup, apply sufficient sand cover to prevent pickup.
   1. Construction Joints
   1. Bond construction joints to provide uniform bearing capacity.
   1. MIXED-IN-PLACE BASE COURSE
   1. Pulverization
   1. Pulverize the soil prior to addition of cement for mixing so that, at the completion of moist-mixing, 100 percent by dry weight passes a 25.4-mm (1-inch) sieve and a minimum of 80 percent passes a 4.75-mm (No. 4) sieve, exclusive of gravel or stone retained on the sieves. Reject stone exceeding 100 mm (4 inches) in size.
   1. Placing and Mixing
   1. Construct the base course in layers between 150 and 250 mm (6 and 10 inches) in thickness after compaction. Place each layer of pulverized soil uniform in thickness and blended to attain a uniform homogeneous mixture before spreading the cement.
   1. Rake previously placed and compacted layer to a depth of 25 mm (1 inch) maximum and moisten with water prior to placing succeeding layer.
   1. Uniformly distribute the cement using a cement spreader equipped with controls to insure accurate distribution and control to within plus or minus 3 percent by weight. Do not use a stone spreader or other such equipment.
   1. Mix the cement to the full depth of the layer by a pulvi-mixer, single pass or double pass stabilizer or other suitable field mixer capable of producing a uniform mixture. Do not use road graders and the windrow method of mixing.
   1. Immediately after the soil and cement have been mixed, add water to the mixture, avoiding excessive concentrations of water on or near the surface. Provide water supply and pressure distributing equipment that assures the application within 1-1/2 hours of all mixing water required for the section being constructed.
   1. Continue mixing until a uniform mixture of soil, cement and water is obtained. Take precaution during mixing process to insure minimum damage to the underlying compacted layer and attain the full depth of mixing so that no unbonded material remains. After mixing, provide mixture free from segregation, requiring minimum blading and manipulation.
   1. Compaction
   1. Begin compaction within 30 minutes after mixing is completed and complete final compaction within one hour after distribution of cement.
   1. PLANT MIX BASE COURSE
   1. Mixing
   1. Proportion the mixture accurately and thoroughly mix in a mixing plant. Continue mixing operations until ingredients are distributed uniformly throughout the mixture and the mixture is pulverized so that 100 percent by dry weight passes a 25.4-mm (1-inch) sieve and a minimum of 80 percent passes a 4.75-mm (No. 4) sieve, exclusive of gravel or stone retained on the sieves. Reject stone exceeding 100 mm (4 inches) maximum dimension.
   1. Placing
   1. Haul the mixture in trucks equipped with protective covers. Construct the base course in layers between 150 and 250 mm (6 and 10 inches) in thickness after compaction. Place each layer of mixture on prepared subgrade or previously placed and layer compacted with a mechanical spreader or spreader box. Rake previously placed and compacted layers to a depth of 25 mm (1 inch) maximum and moistened with water prior to placing each succeeding layer.
   1. When placed, provide mixture free from segregation and requiring minimum blading and manipulation.
   1. Compaction
   1. Begin compaction within 30 minutes after start of moist mixing and complete final compaction within one hour after addition of the cement.
   1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. The Owner will employ a testing laboratory to field test the density in place of compacted soil-cement mixture in accordance with ASTM D1556 and to measure the thickness of completed base course.
   1. Fill holes or depressions in base course resulting from tests with lean concrete.
   1. MAINTENANCE AND PROTECTION
   1. Maintain complete base course and protect from damage until application of paving. Provide and maintain immediate repair of any defective or damaged portions of the base course. Make repairs or replacement with lean concrete.
   1. Do not allow traffic other than essential construction equipment related to paving on the completed base course before application of paving. After completion of base course, allow at least 5 days to elapse before construction of paving.
   1. Remove and replace completed base course which has been placed over unstable base course or has been damaged by traffic or climatic conditions.
