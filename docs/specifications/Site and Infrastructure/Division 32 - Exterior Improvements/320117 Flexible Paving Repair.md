1. SECTION 02578
1. AC PAVEMENT REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT

## General

01. DESCRIPTION
   1. This section describes materials, testing, removal, and replacement of asphalt concrete pavement, seal coat, aggregate base course, prime coat, tack coat, and Portland cement concrete surfaces.
   1. This revision reflects incorporation of the new California and CalTrans standards for specifying performance grade (PG) asphalt versus the previous aged-residue (AR) system.

2. Standard Specifications 01000, 01045, 01200, 01310, 01330, 01505, 01510, 01570, 02140, 02222, 02223, 02511, 02528, 03000, 03480, 03482, 09902, 09910, and Division 15.
03. SUBMITTALS** 
   1. Shop drawings shall be submitted in accordance with Section 01330 and the following.
2. Submit information on material sources, designs, and quality certifications.
1. PART 2 - MATERIALS
1. 2.01 ASPHALT CONCRETE PAVING
   1. Mix design and placement of Asphalt Concrete Hot Mix shall comply with section 203-6 and 302-5 of SSPWC. Specifically, Asphalt Concrete shall be C2-PG64-28PM. The Asphalt cement binder shall conform to section 203-1 of SSPWC, table 203-1.2(A), performance grade PG 64-28PM, denoting the use of a polymer modified binder (PMB) to provide extra performance.
1. 2.04 SEAL COAT
   1. Seal coat shall be a slow-setting emulsified asphalt, SS1 anionic emulsion per Table 203-3.2 (A) of the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.
1. 2.05 TACK COAT
   1. Tack coat shall conform to Section 302-5.4 of the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.

Execution
1. 3.01 PAVEMENT REMOVAL
   1. Asphalt Concrete Pavement Cutting Requirements:
      1. Asphalt concrete pavement shall initially be cut with a pavement cutter or other equipment at the limits of the excavation before the pavement is removed. After backfilling and compacting the excavation, asphalt concrete pavement shall be saw cut at a point not less than 9-inches outside the limits of the excavation or the previous pavement cut, whichever is greater, and the additional pavement removed. If the cut is within 3-feet of an existing joint or curb and gutter, the asphalt concrete pavement shall be replaced to the joint or curb and gutter.
2. Portland Cement Concrete Pavement Cutting Requirements:
      1. Concrete pavement, cross gutters, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, or driveways, shall be saw cut at a point 1-foot beyond the edge of the excavation and the strip of improvement removed. Concrete pavement may initially be cut at the limits of the excavation by other methods prior to removal and the saw cut made after backfilling the excavation. If the saw cut falls within 3-feet of a concrete joint or pavement edge, the concrete shall be removed and replaced to the joint or edge.
3. Disposal of Material:
      1. All pavement and other improvements removed shall be disposed of off the site. The cost of such disposal shall be included in the appropriate bid item.
4. Final Pavement Saw Cuts:
      1. Final pavement saw cuts shall be straight along both sides of the trench, parallel to the pipeline alignment, and provide clean, solid, vertical faces free from loose material. Adjoining pavement which has been damaged or disturbed shall also be saw cut and removed. Saw cuts shall be parallel to the pipeline alignment or the roadway centerline or perpendicular to same.
1. 3.02 ASPHALTH CONCRETE PAVEMENT REPLACEMENT

General

: Producing, hauling, placing, compacting, and finishing of asphalt concrete shall conform to Section 302-5 of the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.
2. Base Course, Final Course and Striping:
      1. Base course paving shall be complete at all times to a point not to exceed 1,000 feet behind any working heading. The final asphalt surface course shall be at least 1-inch thick and shall be placed within a period of two weeks after traffic has been returned to that portion of the street. Temporary striping shall be applied after the base course of asphalt concrete pavement has been placed, in the same configuration as the existing permanent striping, so that traffic can be returned to normal patterns. Temporary striping shall be maintained until permanent striping is applied.
1. 3.03 PREPARATION OF SUBGRADE
   1. Subgrade shall be excavated and shaped to line, grade, and cross section. The top 18-inches of subgrade shall be removed and recompacted to 95% relative compaction. All soft material disclosed by the compacting effort shall be removed and replaced. The finished subgrade shall be within a tolerance of Â±0.08 of a foot of the grade and cross section shown, smooth and free from irregularities and at the specified relative compaction. The subgrade shall be considered to extend over the full width of the aggregate base course.
1. 3.04 PLACING PAVEMENT BASE
   1. Base of the Asphalt shall be one sack slurry per section 201-6 Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM) of the SSPWC. 
1. 3.05 PLACING TACK COAT
   1. Tack coat shall be applied at the rate of 0.05 gallons per square yard to the surfaces to receive finish pavement per Section 302-5.4 of the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction. Tack coat shall be applied to existing asphalt, metal, or concrete surfaces that will be in contact with new asphalt concrete paving.
1. 3.06 PLACING ASPHALT PAVING
   1. Asphalt paving shall be applied to the thickness shown on the plans, as listed above, or per the applicable permit. Asphalt paving shall be installed in accordance with Section 302-5 of the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.
1. 3.07 COMPACTION OF BASE AND LEVELING COURSES
   1. Compaction and rolling of base and leveling courses shall begin at the outer edges of the surfacing continue toward the center. Water shall be applied uniformly throughout the material to provide moisture for obtaining the specified compaction. Each layer shall be compacted to the specified relative compaction before the next layer is placed.
1. 3.08 SURFACE TOLERANCE
   1. Finished grade shall not deviate more than 0.02 foot in elevation from the grade indicated on the drawings. Slopes shall not vary more than 1/8-inch in 10 feet from the slopes shown on the drawings.
1. 3.09 CONCRETE CURBS, GUTTERS, AND SIDEWALKS
   1. Concrete curbs, gutters, and sidewalks shall be replaced in accordance with Section 02528, Concrete Curbs, Gutters, and Sidewalks.
1. 3.10 EMULSION-AGGREGATE SLURRY
   1. Certain street sections where shown on the plans or where required by the City may be required to receive an asphaltic slurry seal in conformance with Section 302-4, Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction after the final asphalt surface course. The composition and aggregate grading for slurry shall be Type II of Subsection 203-5.3.
