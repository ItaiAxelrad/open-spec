   1. PREPARATION
   1. Forms
   1. Use forms which are free from warp and substantial enough to maintain their shape and position without springing or settlement when the concrete is placed and mechanically vibrated. Stake, brace and/or securely tie forms. Use new forms or used forms which are clean and approved by the Architect. Construct formwork so that concrete structures are of correct size, shape, alignment, elevation and position.
   1. Tightly and evenly butt forms or liner joints. Rework the damaged edges of reused high-density overlay plywood form liners as required to maintain tight joints. Severely damaged liners will be rejected.
   1. Tape joints in form liners at concrete surfaces to prevent leakage.
   1. Horizontal joints in liners of formwork for concrete are not permitted above finish grade.
   1. To avoid marking or staining of concrete, or uneven curing effect, entirely remove the forms in rapid sequence between expansion joints or other natural termination points.
   1. Thoroughly clean and wet forms prior to placing concrete. Install forms complete for each pour, in correct alignment, shape and elevation, and ready for inspection and approval by the Architect prior to placing concrete.
   1. Chamfer exposed corners and edges as shown, using wood, metal, pvc or rubber chamfer strips fabricated to produce uniform smooth lines and tight edge joints.
   1. Form ties:
      1. factory-fabricated, adjustable-length, removable or snap-off metal form ties, designed to prevent form deflection and to prevent spalling concrete surfaces upon removal.
   1. Provisions for other trades:
      1. Provide openings in concrete formwork to accommodate work of other trades. Determine size and location of openings, recesses and chases from trades providing such items. Accurately place and securely support items built into forms.
   1. Placing Reinforcement
   1. Comply with the specified codes and standards and Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute's recommended practice for "Placing Reinforcing Bars," for details and methods of reinforcement placement and supports, and as herein specified.
   1. Clean reinforcement of loose rust and mill scale, earth, ice and other materials which reduce or destroy bond with concrete.
   1. Accurately position, support and secure reinforcement against displacement by formwork, construction, or concrete placement operations. Locate and support reinforcing by metal chairs, runners, bolsters, spacers and hangers, as required.
   1. Place reinforcement to at least obtain the minimum coverage for concrete protection. Arrange, space, and securely tie bars and bar supports to hold reinforcement in position during concrete placement operations. Set wire ties so ends are directed into concrete, not toward exposed concrete surfaces.
   1. Joints
   1. Construction joints:
      1. Locate and install construction joints which are not shown on the Drawings so as not to impair the strength and appearance of the structure as acceptable to the Architect.
   1. Provide keyways at least 38 mm (1-1/2 inches) deep in all construction joints in walls, slabs, and between walls and footings. Accepted bulkheads designed for this purpose may be used for slabs.
   1. Place construction joints perpendicular to the main reinforcement. Continue all reinforcement across construction joints.
   1. Expansion joints
   1. Construct expansion joints as indicated on the Drawings. Install premolded joint filler strips full thickness, accurately positioned and supported against displacement.
   1. Construct expansion joints as indicated on the Drawings. Install premolded joint filler strips so as to leave a void having a depth equal to the width of the joint plus 3 mm (1/8 inch) for sealing compound. Accurately position and support filler strips against displacement.
   1. Cover expansion joints in retaining walls on the earth fill side with a waterproof fabric membrane such as "All Seal Fabric" by Wasco Products or "Sprandel Cloth" by Sandell Manufacturing Company, or as approved. Extend fabric a minimum of 150 mm (6 inches) either side of joint. Apply fabric or coating of approved asphalt waterproofing mastic and top coat with a full application of the same asphaltic material.
   1. Install steel dowels, rigidly bonded half their length into one side, piercing the premolded joint filler, and wrapped with tar paper for slippage in the other side to ensure continuous vertical alignment.
   1. Install control joints as indicated on the Drawings.
   1. Embedded Items
   1. Set and build into the Work anchorage devices and other embedded items required for the Project.
   1. CONCRETE PLACEMENT

General
   1. Place concrete in compliance with practices and recommendations of ACI 304 and as specified herein.
   1. Placing Concrete in Forms
   1. Deposit concrete continuously or in layers of such thickness that no concrete will be placed on concrete which has hardened sufficiently to cause the formation of seams or planes of weakness within the section.
   1. If a section cannot be placed continuously, provide construction joints as herein specified.
   1. Deposit concrete as nearly as practicable to its final location to avoid segregation due to rehandling or flowing.
   1. Consolidation and Vibration
   1. Consolidate placed concrete by mechanical vibrating equipment supplemented by hand-spading, rodding or tamping. Use equipment and procedures for consolidation of concrete in accordance with the recommended practices of ACI 309 to suit the type of concrete and Project conditions.
   1. Do not use vibrators to transport concrete inside of forms. Insert and withdraw vibrators vertically at uniformly spaced locations not farther than the visible effectiveness of the machine.
   1. Place vibrators to rapidly penetrate the placed layer of concrete and at least 150 mm (6 inches) into the preceding layer. Do not insert vibrators into lower layers of concrete that have begun to set.
   1. At each insertion limit the duration of vibration to the time necessary to consolidate the concrete and complete embedment of reinforcement, and other embedded items without causing segregation of the mix.
   1. FINISH OF FORMED SURFACES
   1. Rough Form Finish
   1. This treatment is for formed concrete surfaces not exposed to view in the finished Work or by other construction unless otherwise indicated.
   1. This is the concrete surface having the texture imparted by the form facing material used, with tie holes and defective areas repaired and patched and fins and other projections exceeding 6 mm (1/4 inch) in height rubbed down or chipped off.
   1. Smooth Form Finish
   1. This treatment is for formed concrete surfaces exposed to view or those to be covered with a material bonded to the concrete such as waterproofing, dampproofing, painted or other similar system.
   1. This is the as-cast concrete surface as obtained with selected form facing material, arranged orderly and symmetrically with a minimum of seams.
    1. Repair and patch defective areas with all fins or other projections completely removed and smoothed.
   1. Provide smooth rubbed finish to scheduled concrete surfaces which have received smooth form finish treatment no later than the day after form removal. Moisten concrete surfaces and rub with carborundum brick or other abrasive until a uniform color and texture is produced. Do not apply cement grout other than that created by the rubbing process.
   1. Related Unformed Surfaces
   1. This treatment is for tops of walls, horizontal offsets and other similar unformed surfaces occurring adjacent to formed surfaces.
   1. Strike off smooth and finish with a texture matching adjacent formed surfaces. Continue final surface treatment of formed surfaces uniformly across adjacent unformed surfaces, unless otherwise shown.
   1. Sandblast Finish
   1. The intent of this treatment is to lightly expose the coarse aggregate.
   1. Clean sandblasted surfaces free of dust and abrasive with water or compressed air containing no oil mist. Remove abrasive and rubbish resulting from sandblasting operations.
   1. Prior to beginning sandblasting operations, review with the Architect the sequence of operations and equipment to be used.
   1. Control sandblasting at various ages of concrete to produce uniform surfaces. Etch surfaces to be sandblasted to provide finish matching approved Sample. Extend sandblasted surfaces 50 mm (2 inches) below finish grade.
   1. Corners shall be free of defects caused by sandblasting.
   1. Employ templates to prevent etching surfaces not required to be sandblasted and to prevent damage to adjacent work.
   1. Provide protection as required to prevent damage to adjacent public or private property, and to prevent injury to other personnel.
   1. CONCRETE CURING

General
   1. Protect freshly placed concrete from premature drying and excessive cold or hot temperature, and maintain without drying at a relatively constant temperature for a period of time necessary for hydration of cement and proper hardening.
   1. Duration of Curing
   1. Continue curing until the cumulative number of hours or fractions thereof during which temperature of the air in contact with the concrete is above 10 degrees C (50 degrees F) has totaled at least 168 hours.
   1. Prevent rapid drying at the end of the curing period.
   1. Curing Methods
   1. Moisture curing:
      1. Execute moisture by covering surface with blankets of wetted burlap. Keep material saturated and in place for at least 168 hours. Apply water in form of spray to avoid damage to fresh concrete. Take precaution to prevent blankets from being displaced.
   1. Liquid membrane curing:
      1. Apply liquid membrane curing compound to cover surface completely and uniformly per manufacturer's instructions and at a rate which will achieve the performance requirement specified in AASHTO Specification M148, but at a rate not less than 1 liter per 4.9 square meters (1 gallon per 200 square feet). Apply membrane curing compound immediately behind final finishing operation. Failure to provide complete and uniform coverage at required rate will be cause for discontinuation of this method of curing and the substitution of moisture curing. Take special care to apply curing compound immediately after forms have been removed.
   1. Curing formed surfaces:
      1. Cure formed concrete surfaces by moisture curing with forms in place for full curing period or until forms are removed. If forms are removed, continue curing by methods specified above, as applicable.
   1. CONCRETE REPAIRS
   1. Remove and replace concrete having defective surfaces if defects cannot be repaired to satisfaction of the Architect. Surface defects, as such, include color and texture irregularities, cracks, spalls, air bubbles, honeycomb, rock pockets, fins and other projections on surface, and stains and other discolorations that cannot be removed by cleaning.
   1. Repair and patch defective areas with cement mortar immediately after removal of forms, but only when acceptable to the Architect.
   1. Cut out honeycomb, rock pockets, voids over 6 mm (1/4 inch) in any dimension, and holes left by tie rods and bolts down to solid concrete, but in no case to a depth of less than 25 mm (1 inch). Make edges of cuts perpendicular to the concrete surface. Before placing cement mortar or proprietary patching compound, thoroughly clean, dampen with water, and brush-coat the area to be patched with neat cement grout, or proprietary bonding agent.
   1. For exposed-to-view surfaces, blend white portland cement and standard portland cement so that, when dry, patching mortar will match surrounding color. Provide test areas at inconspicuous locations to verify mixture and color match before proceeding with patching. Compact mortar in place and strike off slightly higher than surrounding surface.
