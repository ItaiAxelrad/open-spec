   1. MYCORRHIZAL INOCULUM
   1. Apply Mycorrhizal Inoculum, per manufacturer’s recommendations, at a rate of 60lbs. per acre (67.5 kg/ha)/1.4 lbs. per 1,000 ft²(0.7 kg / 100 m²), by the following methods (as applicable):
      1. Seed Drilling:
         1. Incorporate mycorrhizal inoculum into the soil at a depth ranger at or below the seed.
   1. Broadcast and Till:
      1. Evenly distribute mycorrhizal inoculum across seedbed after seeding. Cover the exposed seed and inoculum by harrowing, chain dragging or applying an organic topdressing. Do not leave inoculum exposed to sunlight for more than four hours.
   1. Nursery Medium:
      1. Evenly blendmycorrhizal inoculum at 5 lbs per yd³ (3 kg. Per m³). 1 lb. (454 grams) contains approximately 60,000 living propagules. Rate provides 300,000 living propagules per yd³ (396,000 living propagules per m³) or 6.5 living propagules per in³.
   1. SEEDING
   1. Drill seeded areas shall use a Truax or other native grass drill with separate seed boxes for different seed sizes, agitators in the boxes, Coulter wheels, depth bands, seed rows no wider than 7 inches. Seed shall be drilled in two applications at 90 degrees to each other, 50 percent plus or minus of seed applied in each pass using a Brillion seed application or approved equal.
   1. Seed shall be drilled parallel to the slope in the final pass.
   1. Set depth bands to 1/4 to 1/3 inch depth. Seed shall be drilled in such a manner that after surface is raked and rolled, seed shall have about 1/4 of cover.
   1. Seed shall not be drilled during windy weather or when ground is frozen or snow covered or untillable.
   1. Seeding schedule to be coordinated with Owner, Contractor and Architect to ensure optimal success.
   1. Rake seeded areas to ensure good soil contact, raking always in direction perpendicular to slope of the land.
   1. Application Rate:
      1. shall be as indicated on the seed mix tables.
   1. Areas inaccessible to drilling equipment may be seeded by broadcasting using a mechanical spreader or by hand.
   1. Rake to cover seed with 1/4 to 1/3 inch soil.
   1. Application Rate:
      1. shall be two times the drill seed rate.
   1. NATIVE SEEDED SOD
   1. Soil on which sod is laid shall be slightly moist.
   1. Lay with longest dimension parallel to contours and in continuous rows.
   1. Tightly butt ends and sides of sod together. Stagger sod rows by 2'-0" minimum and compact vertical joints between sod strips by rolling so sod will be incorporated with the ground surface, insuring tight joints between adjacent pieces. Sod shrinkage is grounds for rejection.
   1. Cut rows terminating on the designated property lines to a straight line.
   1. Use a sod cutter to provide a clean edge on existing sod if required. New to existing sod edge must match smoothly.
   1. Rolling
   1. When soil and sod are moist, roll sod lightly as soon as possible after it is laid.
   1. Delay rolling until just before the second watering.
   1. Reroll sod as necessary prior to acceptance.
   1. Assure finished areas of sod are such that positive drainage of storm and irrigation water will occur and ponding of water will be minimized.
   1. RUNOFF
   1. Take measures and furnish equipment and labor necessary to control the flow, drainage, and accumulation of water to run off the grounds as is intended by the grades.
   1. EROSION CONTROL
   1. Take measures and furnish equipment and labor necessary to control and prevent soil erosion, blowing soil and accumulation of wind-deposited materials on the site throughout the duration of work.
   1. Erosion damage is the Contractor's responsibility once site disruption begins.
   1. Refer to Section 312500 Temporary Erosion and Sedimentation Control
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Inspection
   1. Provide notice to Owner requesting inspection at least seven (7) days prior to anticipated date of completion.
   1. Deficiencies
   1. Owner will specify deficiencies to Contractor who shall make satisfactory adjustments and shall again notify Owner for final inspection.
   1. Notification
   1. Give notice requesting inspection by Owner at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated date of completion.
   1. All new sod must be alive and healthy in order to be considered complete.
   1. If deficiencies exist, Owner shall specify such deficiencies to the Contractor who shall make satisfactory adjustments and will again notify the Owner for final inspection.
   1. CLEANING
   1. Remove debris and excess materials from site.
   1. Clean out drainage inlet structures as required.
   1. Clean paved and finished surfaces soiled as a result of work under this Section, in accordance with direction given by Owner.
   1. Remove debris and excess materials from site.
   1. Clean paved and finished areas soiled as a result of work under this Section, in accordance with direction given by Owner.
   1. Clean out drainage inlet structures.
   1. Remove mulch immediately from trees, shrubs and sod to prevent damage to same.
   1. Remove pallets, unused sod, and other debris from site.
   1. Clean paved and finished surfaces soiled as a result of work under this Section.
   1. PROTECTION
   1. Provide and install barriers as required and as directed by Owner to protect completed areas against damage from pedestrian and vehicular traffic until acceptance by Owner.
   1. Contractor is not responsible for malicious destruction caused by others.
   1. MAINTENANCE AND ACCEPTANCE
   1. Maintenance period shall begin immediately after each area is seeded or sodded, and continue for 1 year until final acceptance of landscaping work by NREL.
   1. During this time water, mow, spot spray with approved herbicides (after seedlings are no longer sensitive to them), hand weed, as necessary to insure that seeded areas are in a vigorous growing condition until final acceptance.
   1. Bare areas over 1 square feet in size shall be reseeded and mulched if they fail to establish at least 6 desirable seedlings/sq. ft. (non-irrigated areas) or 12 desirable seedlings/sq. ft. (irrigated areas). The Landscape Architect or Ecologist will direct Contractor on what areas need to be reseeded during establishment inspection approximately 30 days after seeding (June-September).
   1. Seeded areas shall be mowed for annual weed control, if so directed by the Landscape Architect, at a height of not less than 6 inches and otherwise maintained until there is an acceptable uniform plant growth. A small tractor or mower shall be used to reduce possible crushing of seedling grasses and rutting of soil.
   1. Areas that are irrigated and are not producing a uniform plant growth within 30 days following first seeding, as determined by establishment inspection, shall be reseeded.
   1. Acceptable uniform plant growth shall be defined as the following, whichever is the more strict:
      1. 70% of predisturbance vegetative cover.
   1. At least 6 desirable seedlings/sq. ft. (non-irrigated areas) or 12 desirable seedlings/sq. ft. (in irrigated areas). Scattered bare spots, no greater than 1 sq. ft. and not exceeding 5 percent of seeded area may be acceptable, if approved by Landscape Architect or Ecologist.
