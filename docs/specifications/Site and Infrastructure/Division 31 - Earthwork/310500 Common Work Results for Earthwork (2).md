   1. Contractor’s Option:
      1. Graded gravel or flowable fill may be used to replace structural backfill material as specified herein and where shown on the Drawings:
      1. 
   1. DRAINAGE MAINTENANCE 
   1. Do not backfill trenches across roadways, drives, walks or other trafficways adjacent to drainage ditches or water courses prior to backfilling the trench on the upstream side of the trafficway to prevent impounding water after pipe is laid 
   1. Backfill so that water does not accumulate in unfilled or partially filled trenches
   1. Remove materials deposited in roadway ditches or other water courses crossed by the trench line immediately after backfilling is completed and restore ditches and water courses to original section, grade, and contours
   1. Do not obstruct surface drainage any longer than necessary
   1. Provide and maintain temporary bridges and other structures across unfilled trenches as required to maintain traffic
   1. PROTECTION OF TRENCH BACKFILL
   1. Where trenches are constructed in ditches or other water courses, protect backfill from erosion
   1. Install ditch checks where the ditch grade exceeds 1 percent:
      1. Minimum depth:
         1. 2 feet below the original ditch or water course bottom for the full bottom width
   1. Minimum width:
      1. 18 inches into the side slopes
   1. Minimum thickness:
      1. 12 inches
   1. DISPOSAL OF EXCESS EXCAVATED MATERIALS
   1. Use excess excavated materials in fills and embankments as required or as indicated on the Drawings to the extent needed
   1. Remove debris, junk, broken concrete, broken asphalt, rock, stones, stumps, logs, roots, and other unsuitable material from the site and dispose of it
   1. Except as otherwise permitted, dispose of excess excavated materials away from the site of the Work or as directed by Owner
   1. Distribute excess earth from excavations located in unimproved property directly over the pipe trench and within the pipeline right-of-way to a max depth of 6 inch above the original ground surface elevation at and across the trench and sloping uniformly each way:
      1. Carefully finish material thus wasted with a drag, blade machine, or other suitable tool to a smooth, uniform surface without obstructing drainage at any point
   1. Do not waste excess excavated material in the above manner where the trench lines crosses or is within a railroad, public road, or highway right-of-way
   1. FINAL GRADING
   1. After completion of all other outside work and after backfilling is completed and settled, bring to grade at the indicated elevations all areas of the site to be graded
   1. Graders and other power equipment may be used for final grading and slope dressing if the result is uniform and equivalent to hand work
   1. Grade all surfaces for effective drainage
   1. Provide a 2 percent minimum slope except as otherwise required
   1. Grade and surface to maintain gradient as indicated
   1. SLOPE STABILIZATION
   1. Prepare disturbed areas for seeding by others
   1. Cover slopes with erosion control fabric where grade is 3H to 1V or greater and where indicated on the Drawings
   1. Lay fabric smoothly on surface, bury top end of each section in 6 inch deep excavated topsoil trench. Provide 6 inch overlap minimum of adjacent rolls. Backfill trench and rake smooth, level with adjacent soil
   1. Secure outside edges and overlaps at 48 inch intervals with 4-inch to 6-inch U‑shaped type pins or wooden stakes depending on ground condition
   1. Lightly dress slopes with topsoil to ensure close contact between fabric and soil
   1. At sides of ditches, lay fabric laps in direction of water flow. Lap ends and edges minimum 6 inches
   1. EROSION CONTROL BARRIERS
   1. Place erosion control barriers where required and where directed by Engineer in accordance with requirements of approved site improvement plan
   1. Field locate barriers along slopes, next to water courses and downstream of disturbed areas to prevent surface runoff from eroding areas disturbed by Contractor during construction, to minimize the transport of suspended solids downstream or into adjacent streams, canals or ditches and to protect newly seeded areas
   1. Maintain and replace barriers as required for effective erosion control until satisfactory uniform plant growth is established as defined herein
   1. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
   1. Submit General Permit Application to CDPHE for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity and comply with all conditions of the permit
   1. Reference Stormwater Management Plan included in these Contract Documents
   1. Obtain and comply with conditions of CDPHE construction stormwater management permit:
      1. Requirements for permit application are attached immediately following this section
   1. SETTLEMENT
   1. Warranty for settlement of all fills, embankments, and backfills is stipulated in the General Conditions from final completion of Contract under which Work is performed
   1. Repair or replace within 30 days after notice by Engineer or Owner
   1. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Provide under provisions of Section 01400 for field inspections and testing
   1. Coordinate and pay for all tests to determine compliance of in-place and backfill materials and compaction in accordance with the specifications
   1. Fills and Embankment:
      1. Two moisture-density relationship tests, ASTM D698, on each type of fill material
   1. One in-place compaction test for each 200 sf every 1.5 feet of vertical lift of material placed 
   1. Pipe Embedment and Backfill:
      1. Two initial gradation tests for each type of material plus 1 additional test for 500 cubic yards of each material
   1. Daily penetrometer testing of flowable fill material
   1. Two moisture-density relationship tests, ASTM D698, or 2 relative density tests, ASTM D4253/D4254, as appropriate for each type of embedment on backfill material proposed, except granular embedment material
   1. One in-place compaction test every 50 lineal feet of trench in the compacted embedment zone and at every 1.5 feet of vertical lift of backfill materials, ASTM D2922/D3017
   1. One in-place compaction test near top of trench for trench depth of 2 feet or less, ASTM D2922/D3017
   1. Five (5) additional in-place compaction tests at the discretion of the Engineer, ASTM D2922/D3017
