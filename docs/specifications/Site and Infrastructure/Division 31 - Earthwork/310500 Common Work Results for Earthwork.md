		3. Do not carry excavations lower than shown for foundations except as directed by Soils Engineer or Engineer.
		4. If any part of excavations is carried below required depth without authorization, maintain excavation and start foundation from excavated level with concrete of same strength as required for superimposed foundation, and no extra compensation will be made to Contractor therefore.
	5. Notify Soils Engineer and Engineer as soon as excavation is completed in order that subgrades may be inspected.
		1. Do not commence further construction until subgrade under compacted fill material, under foundations, under floor slabs-on-grade, under equipment support pads, and under retaining wall footings has been inspected and approved by the Soils Engineer as being free of undesirable material, being of compaction density required by this specification, and being capable of supporting the allowable foundation design bearing pressures and superimposed foundation, fill, and building loads to be placed thereon.
		2. Soils Engineer shall be given the opportunity to inspect subgrade below fill material both prior to and after subgrade compaction.
		3. Place fill material, foundations, retaining wall footings, floor slabs-on-grade, and equipment support pads as soon as weather conditions permit after excavation is completed, inspected, and approved and after forms and reinforcing are inspected and approved.
		4. Before concrete or fill material is placed, protect approved subgrade from becoming loose, wet, frozen, or soft due to weather, construction operations, or other reasons.
	6. Dewatering:
		1. Where groundwater is or is expected to be encountered during excavation, install a dewatering system to prevent softening and disturbance of subgrade below foundations and fill material, to allow foundations and fill material to be placed in the dry, and to maintain a stable excavation side slope.

		6. Dispose of groundwater to an area which will not interfere with construction operations or damage existing construction.
			1. Install groundwater monitoring wells as necessary.
		7. Shut off dewatering system at such a rate to prevent a quick upsurge of water that might weaken the subgrade.
	7. Subgrade stabilization:
		1. If subgrade under foundations, fill material, floor slabs-on-grade, or equipment support pads is in a frozen, loose, wet, or soft condition before construction is placed thereon, remove frozen, loose, wet, or soft material and replace with approved compacted material as directed by Soils Engineer.

	9. Protection of structures:
		1. Prevent new and existing structures from becoming damaged due to construction operations or other reasons.
		2. Prevent subgrade under new and existing foundations from becoming wet and undermined during construction due to presence of surface or subsurface water or due to construction operations.
	10. Shoring:
		1. Shore, sheet pile, slope, or brace excavations as required to prevent them from collapsing.
		2. Remove shoring as backfilling progresses but only when banks are stable and safe from caving or collapse.
	11. Drainage:
