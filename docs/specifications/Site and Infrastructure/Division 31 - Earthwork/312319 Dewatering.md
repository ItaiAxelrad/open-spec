General
   1. RELATED DOCUMENTS
   1. Drawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary Conditions and Division 1 Specification Sections, apply to this Section.
   1. SUMMARY
   1. This Section includes construction dewatering. Subsurface drainage systems Section 334600 can be used in conjunction with Dewatering, if practical.
   1. Related Sections include the following:
      1. Division 1 Section "Temporary Facilities and Controls" for temporary utilities and support facilities.
   1. Division 2 Section "Excavation Support and Protection."
   1. Division 2 Section "Earthwork" for excavating, backfilling, site grading and for site utilities.
   1. Division 2 Section "Subsurface Drainage Systems" for permanent foundation wall, underfloor, and footing drainage.
   1. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
   1. Dewatering Performance:
      1. Design, furnish, install, test, operate, monitor, and maintain dewatering system of sufficient scope, size, and capacity to control ground-water flow into excavations and permit construction to proceed on dry, stable subgrades.
   1. Maintain dewatering operations to ensure erosion control, stability of excavations and constructed slopes, that excavation does not flood, and that damage to subgrades and permanent structures is prevented.
   1. Prevent surface water from entering excavations by grading, dikes, or other means.
   1. Accomplish dewatering without damaging existing buildings adjacent to excavation.
   1. Remove dewatering system if no longer needed.
   1. SUBMITTALS
   1. Shop Drawings for Information:
      1. For dewatering system. Show arrangement, locations, and details of wells and well points; locations of headers and discharge lines; and means of discharge and disposal of water.
   1. Include layouts of piezometers and flow-measuring devices for monitoring performance of dewatering system.
   1. Include a written report outlining control procedures to be adopted if dewatering problems arise.
   1. Include Shop Drawings signed and sealed by the qualified professional engineer responsible for their preparation.
   1. Qualification Data:
      1. For Installer and Professional Engineer.
   1. Photographs or videotape, sufficiently detailed, of existing conditions of adjoining construction and site improvements that might be misconstrued as damage caused by dewatering operations.
   1. Record drawings at Project closeout identifying and locating capped utilities and other subsurface structural, electrical, or mechanical conditions performed during dewatering.
   1. Note locations and capping depth of wells and well points.
   1. Field Test Reports:
      1. Before starting excavation, submit test results and computations demonstrating that dewatering system is capable of meeting performance requirements.
   1. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   1. Regulatory Requirements:
      1. Comply with water disposal requirements of authorities having jurisdiction.
   1. Preinstallation Conference:
      1. Conduct conference at Project site to comply with requirements in Division 1 Section "Project Management and Coordination."
   1. PROJECT CONDITIONS
   1. Existing Utilities:
      1. Do not interrupt utilities serving facilities occupied by Owner or others unless permitted in writing by Architect and then only after arranging to provide temporary utility services according to requirements indicated.
   1. Project-Site Information:
      1. A geotechnical report has been prepared for this Project and is available for information only. The opinions expressed in this report are those of geotechnical engineer and represent interpretations of subsoil conditions, tests, and results of analyses conducted by geotechnical engineer. Owner will not be responsible for interpretations or conclusions drawn from this data.
   1. Make additional test borings and conduct other exploratory operations necessary for dewatering.
   1. The geotechnical report is referenced elsewhere in the Project Manual.
   1. Survey adjacent structures and improvements, employing a qualified professional engineer or land surveyor, establishing exact elevations at fixed points to act as benchmarks. Clearly identify benchmarks and record existing elevations.
   1. During dewatering, regularly resurvey benchmarks, maintaining an accurate log of surveyed elevations for comparison with original elevations. Promptly notify Architect if changes in elevations occur or if cracks, sags, or other damage is evident in adjacent construction.
   1. PRODUCTS (NOT USED)
   1. EXECUTION
   1. PREPARATION
   1. Protect structures, utilities, sidewalks, pavements, and other facilities from damage caused by settlement, lateral movement, undermining, washout, and other hazards created by dewatering operations.
   1. Prevent surface water and subsurface or ground water from entering excavations, from ponding on prepared subgrades, and from flooding site and surrounding area.
   1. Protect subgrades and foundation soils from softening and damage by rain or water accumulation.
   1. Install dewatering system to ensure minimum interference with roads, streets, walks, and other adjacent occupied and used facilities.
   1. Do not close or obstruct streets, walks, or other adjacent occupied or used facilities without permission from Owner and authorities having jurisdiction. Provide alternate routes around closed or obstructed traffic ways if required by authorities having jurisdiction.
   1. INSTALLATION
   1. Install dewatering system utilizing wells, well points, or similar methods complete with pump equipment, standby power and pumps, filter material gradation, valves, appurtenances, water disposal, and surface-water controls.
   1. Before excavating below ground-water level, place system into operation to lower water to specified levels. Operate system continuously until drains, sewers, and structures have been constructed and fill materials have been placed, or until dewatering is no longer required.
   1. Provide an adequate system to lower and control ground water to permit excavation, construction of structures, and placement of fill materials on dry subgrades. Install sufficient dewatering equipment to drain water-bearing strata above and below bottom of foundations, drains, sewers, and other excavations.
   1. Do not permit open-sump pumping that leads to loss of fines, soil piping, subgrade softening, and slope instability.
   1. Reduce hydrostatic head in water-bearing strata below subgrade elevations of foundations, drains, sewers, and other excavations.
   1. Maintain piezometric water level a minimum of 24 inches (600 mm) below surface of excavation.
   1. Dispose of water removed by dewatering in a manner that avoids endangering public health, property, and portions of work under construction or completed. Dispose of water in a manner that avoids inconvenience to others. Provide sumps, sedimentation tanks, and other flow-control devices as required by authorities having jurisdiction.
   1. Provide standby equipment on-site, installed and available for immediate operation, to maintain dewatering on continuous basis if any part of system becomes inadequate or fails. If dewatering requirements are not satisfied due to inadequacy or failure of dewatering system, restore damaged structures and foundation soils at no additional expense to Owner.
   1. Remove dewatering system from Project site on completion of dewatering. Plug or fill well holes with sand or cut off and cap wells a minimum of 36 inches (900 mm) below overlying construction.
   1. Damages:
      1. Promptly repair damages to adjacent facilities caused by dewatering operations.
   1. OBSERVATION WELLS
   1. Provide, take measurements, and maintain at least the minimum number of observation wells or piezometers indicated and additional observation wells as may be required by authorities having jurisdiction.
   1. Observe and record daily elevation of ground water and piezometric water levels in observation wells.
   1. Repair or replace, within 24 hours, observation wells that become inactive, damaged, or destroyed. Suspend construction activities in areas where observation wells are not functioning properly until reliable observations can be made. Add or remove water from observation-well risers to demonstrate that observation wells are functioning properly.
   1. Fill observation wells, remove piezometers, and fill holes when dewatering is completed.
