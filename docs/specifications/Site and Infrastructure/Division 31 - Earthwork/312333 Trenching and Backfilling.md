All materials removed and not reused shall be hauled from the site and disposed of by the Contractor.
   1. SUBSURFACE INFORMATION:
      1. Except as may be shown on the Drawings or set forth in “Special Construction Provisions”, no additional subsurface exploration has been made along the pipeline alignment as a part of this project.
   1. CLASSIFIED EXCAVATION:
      1. Excavation will be classified as “Earth” or “Rock”. The cost for all Earth excavation is to be included in the installed pipe unit price, as provided in the Proposal. Rock excavation will be paid for separately, over and above the cost of earth excavation, when rock removal conforms to the stipulations included herein.
   1. Excavation shall be categorized for payment purposes according to the following criteria:
      1. 
* 
	1. Earth Excavation: Earth Excavation shall include all material not having properties required for classifications as rock excavations; shall include all loose, broken, and/or laminated rock or stones and boulders which can be reasonably broken, plowed, and removed with skillfully operated, power-driven excavating equipment and having comparable capabilities of a Caterpillar 235 backhoe or equal.
   1. Soft sandstone or similar material which can be reasonably broken and removed by a backhoe or trencher will not be classified or paid for as Rock Excavation.

* 
	1. Rock Excavation shall include all solid rock masses which cannot be reasonably broken, plowed and removed with power-driven equipment specified above in Earth Excavation and boulders or tones which, because of size or position in the trench, require blasting for removal.
   1. For blasting operations, suitable weighted coverings shall be provided to confine all materials lifted by the blasting to within the limits of the trench or other excavation. The Contractor shall comply with all laws, ordinances and applicable safety code requirements and regulations relative to the handling, storage and use of explosives and the protection of life and property and he shall be responsible for all damage thereto caused by his blasting operations.
   1. As rock excavation is encountered, the Engineer and the Contractor must agree that such material to be excavated is Rock. At the end of each day's work, the Engineer, upon request, will calculate and inform the Contractor of the amount of Rock excavated for payment purposes. If the Contractor does not agree to the Engineer's quantities, he shall notify the Owner within one day.
   1. DEFINITIONS:
      1. 

* 
	1. Compaction Density: Unless accurate results cannot be obtained, the compaction requirements shall conform to maximum dry density according to ASTM D698, Moisture-Density Relations of Soils (Standard Proctor). When the ASTM D698 test is not applicable, the percentage compaction requirements shall conform to ASTM D2049, Test for Relative Density of Cohesionless Soils, unless otherwise noted. The moisture content of all backfill material shall be within 2% of optimum unless otherwise noted.
	2. Trench Zones: For the purpose of this Specification, the terms “Bedding Zone,” “Pipe Zone” and “Backfill Zone” shall refer to the trench zones identified on the Typical Trench Detailsshown on the Drawings.
		1. Bedding Zone Material: Bedding zone material shall consist of all material placed below the pipe invert or, when permitted, the native materials graded and prepared for direct placement of the pipe.
		2. Pipe Zone Material: Pipe zone material shall consist of all material placed above the pipe invert to an elevation shown on the details.

      1. 
* 
	
General
: Existing power lines, telephone lines, fences, water mains, cables, conduits, ditches, embankments and other structures in the vicinity of the work not authorized to be removed, shall be supported and protected from injury by the Contractor during the construction and until completion of the work affecting them. The Contractor shall be liable for all damages done to such existing facilities and structures, as herein provided and he shall protect the Owner from any liability or expense for injuries, damages, or repairs to such facilities.
	2. Underground Facilities: The type, size, location and number of all known underground facilities have been shown on the Drawings; however, no guarantee is made as to the true type, size, location, or number of such facilities. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to verify the existence and location of all underground utilities along the route of the work. The omission from, or the inclusion of, utility locations on the Drawings is not to be considered as the nonexistence of, or a definite location of, existing underground utilities. When working in areas of known pipes where the depth of pipe is not known, potholing shall be completed before any trenching shall begin. All utilities within the trenching limits of the pipe shall be potholed to verify their location and elevation before trenching begins.
   1. The Contractor shall notify the owner or owners of the existing utilities, whether aboveground or underground, 48 hours prior to proceeding with excavation whenever such operations are within ten feet of the possible location of any existing utility. The notification shall also include a request for field staking any such underground facility that may be in the area of influence by the construction.
   1. Should any such utility be damaged in the excavation operations, the Contractor shall immediately notify the owner of such utility and, unless authorized in writing by the Owner of the utility, the Contractor shall not attempt to make repairs except to prevent further damage to property. Duplicate copies of any written authorization given to the Contractor to make repairs shall be filed with the Engineer and shall be so worded as to save the Owner from any responsibility whatsoever relative to the sufficiency of the repairs.
   1. If a conflict that is not shown on the Drawings develops between an existing utility and the work required by this Contract, the Contractor shall notify the owner of the utility and the Engineer immediately in writing. The Engineer may consider such conflict to be a change in the work. The Contractor may request a change in the Contract amount for such change in the work, subject to the General Conditions.
   1. If during construction any underground utility conduit, including sewers, water mains, gas mains and drainage structures, or any aboveground utility facilities are required to be relocated, the Contractor shall notify the utility owner well in advance of his approach to such utility so that arrangements with the owner or owners of the affected utility can be completed without delay to the work.

* 
	1. Land Markers: Monuments, property pins, survey reference points, and benchmarks shall not be disturbed without specific written permission from the Engineer. Any such markers disturbed without written permission shall be replaced at the Contractor’s expense by a licensed land surveyor.

   1. PART 3:
      1. EXECUTION
   1. PREPARATION:
      1. 
* 
	
General
: In natural areas, strip all topsoil, or in the absence of topsoil, strip the top surface material and store separately from other excavated materials in stockpile areas designated by the Owner.
   1. In turf areas, separate excavated topsoil from other excavated materials. Stockpile all materials on filter fabric or burlap. Stockpiling on walks will not be allowed. Stockpiled materials will not be allowed on growing turf for more than 5 days. In turf areas remove sod with sod cutting machine in a manner that provides straight and uniform edges.
   1. TRENCH EXCAVATION:
      1. 
* 
	
General
: Excavate trenches to lines, grades, and elevations indicated or staked in the field. Fine grade the trench bottom throughout and excavate to accommodate joints and connections so the barrel of the pipe will receive bearing pressure throughout its entire length.
	2. Trench Depth: The trenches shall be excavated to such depths that the pipeline can be laid at the elevation of the grade lines shown on the Drawings, or at the depths or covers specified on the Drawings or as specified in the Sections for specific pipeline installations. 
	3. Existing Asphalt Pavement: The excavation in areas with asphalt paving must be confined to a minimum width as required to maintain a safe trench condition. The pavement shall be cut vertical and on a straight line.
   1. Replacement of asphalt shall be in accordance with Section 02600, “Asphalt Paving”.

* 
	1. Existing Gravel Surfacing: The gravel surfacing that is removed, disturbed, and/or contaminated during trench excavation shall be replaced to existing depth but to not less than 4 inches compacted depth of CDOT Class 6 Roadbase and shall be in accordance with Paragraph 17. 
	2. Trench Preparation: The trench wall shall be so braced that the workmen may work safely and efficiently. All trenches shall be drained so that pipe laying may take place in dewatered conditions.
   1. Trenches above a point 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be of such extra width, when required, as will permit the convenient placing of timber supports, sheeting and bracing, and the handling of special units as necessary.
   1. Bell holes in trench bottom shall be provided at each joint to permit the jointing to be made properly and to prevent the pipe from bearing on the bells.
   1. After excavation, the trench bottom shall be uniformly graded and hand-shaped so that the pipe barrel will have uniform and continuous bearing on firm, undisturbed trench bottom (when permitted), or compacted, specified granular bedding throughout the length of the pipe. The trench grade shall permit the pipe spigot to be accurately centered in the preceding-laid pipe joint, without lifting the pipe above the grade and without exceeding the permissible joint deflection. If it is necessary to raise the pipe subgrade, approved, compacted granular bedding material shall be used.
   1. If unstable foundation is encountered, the Contractor shall excavate the unstable material and backfill the over-excavation with 1½-inch uniformly graded, crushed rock concrete aggregate.

* 
	1. Shoring: As needed, all trench sidewalls shall be properly sheeted and braced to meet Federal, State and local laws in regard to safe working conditions. The shoring shall be arranged so as not to place any stress on portions of the completed work until the general construction thereof has proceeded far enough to provide ample strength.
   1. If the Engineer is of the opinion that at any point the trench walls are not properly supported to protect the work, he may order the placement of additional supports by the Contractor. Compliance with such order shall not relieve or release the Contractor from his responsibilities for the safety of the work.

* 
	1. Blasting: No blasting will be allowed.
	2. Removal of Water: The Contractor shall provide and maintain at all times ample means and devices with which to remove promptly and to properly dispose of all water entering the trench excavation so that pipe laying, forming and concrete work can be carried on under dewatered conditions.
   1. Water shall be disposed of in a suitable manner without damage to adjacent property or without being a menace to public health and convenience. No water shall be drained into work built or under construction without prior consent of the Engineer.
   1. Dewatering shall be accomplished by well points, sumping, or any other acceptable method which will insure an dewatered trench to a sufficient depth below trench bottom, so that the Contractor's operations will not disturb the trench bottom. Any dewatering method shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer. Dewatering by over excavation and installation of crushed rock shall not be considered as rock used for trench stabilization.

* 
	1. Trench Width: The minimum clear trench width measured at the top of the pipe barrel shall be not less than the outside pipe diameter, plus 16 inches. For all pipe, the maximum clear trench width measured at a point 12 inches above the top of the pipe barrel shall be not greater than the trench width shown on the following table:

   1. If the above-stated maximum trench widths are exceeded, either through accident or otherwise, and if the Engineer determines that the combined dead and live loads will exceed the design loadings on the pipe, the Contractor shall either cradle the pipe in concrete or use a pipe of a stronger class as required by the Engineer. 

* 
	1. Trench Walls: All the trench sidewalls shall be considered to be vertical from the bottom to the top of the excavation.
   1. The Contractor may slope or bench the trench sidewalls when necessary due to soils conditions to maintain a safe trench condition and conform to OSHA requirements. Such sloping or benching shall terminate at a depth not lower than one foot above the top of the pipe barrel, and from that point down, the trench wall shall be vertical. The trenching operation, including the spoil bank and sloping of the trench sidewalls shall be confined to the width of the permanent and temporary rights-of-way, if any. The Contractor shall provide a design for sloping or benching by a registered professional engineer for trenches over 20 feet in depth.
   1. A clear area shall be maintained a sufficient distance back from the top edge of the excavation to avoid overloading that may cause slides or caving of the trench walls. The excavated material shall be kept trimmed in such a manner as to be of as little inconvenience as possible to the public and adjoining property owners. Unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer, all public thoroughfares and crossroads shall be kept open to traffic. When authorized by the Engineer at street crossings, sidewalks and other points considered necessary, the trenches shall be bridged in a safe manner so as to prevent serious interruption of travel and to provide access to fire hydrants and public and private premises.
   1. Bedding and Backfill Installation:
      1. 
* 
	
General
: Unless accurate results cannot be obtained, the compaction requirements shall conform to maximum dry density according to ASTM D698, Moisture-Density Relations of Soils (Standard Proctor). When the ASTM D698 test is not applicable, the percentage compaction requirements shall conform to ASTM D2049, Test for Relative Density of Cohesionless Soils.
   1. When required by the Engineer, the Contractor shall excavate backfilled trenches for the purpose of performing compaction tests at locations and depths required by the Engineer.

* 
	1. Bedding zone installation: Bedding material shall consist of the material on which the pipe is placed in accordance with the Pipe Trench Details. Bedding material shall be placed to the required elevation of the pipe invert. Tamping equipment shall be used to thoroughly tamp the bedding material to a minimum of 95 percent maximum dry density or to 75 percent relative density. The moisture content of the material shall be within 2 percent of optimum.
	2. Pipe zone installation: After bedding material has been placed and approved and after the pipe has been installed and approved, the pipe zone backfill shall be installed to an elevation shown on the details on the drawings.
   1. The backfill material shall be as specified on the details and shall be placed and compacted in distinct, separate lifts not to exceed 6 inches of loose depth; except that the first loose lift shall not be higher than the pipe centerline (springline). If select backfill materials are permitted in this zone but acceptable select backfill material (suitable for placement within 12 inches of the pipe barrel) is not available at any particular location, the Contractor shall use imported granular backfill material. Compaction shall meet the requirement of “Bedding Zone Installation,” utilizing T-bars or mechanical tamping equipment.

* 
	1. Backfill zone installation. Unless otherwise provided in the Special Construction Provisions and Paragraph 3-3.E, the following method of installation shall apply. After the pipe zone backfill has been placed and accepted, the trench shall be backfilled. All backfill above the pipe zone backfill shall be carefully placed in the trench in lifts no greater than 2 feet. Each lift shall be compacted by mechanical equipment to 90 percent of laboratory dry density. After the trench is backfilled to the ground surface a loaded dump truck or loader placed in the trench line shall compact the backfill by its wheel load. No less than two passes shall be made. If the backfill is depressed below the finished grade elevation, the depressed area shall be refilled and compacted. The backfill shall be mounded higher than the adjacent ground to allow for settlement.
	2. Backfill zone installation in roads and streets. Beneath all traveled way‑in roads, streets, and parking areas; highway shoulders and within 15 feet of pavement in State Highway Department rights‑of‑way, backfill material shall be care­fully placed and compacted up to the limit of base course material or to gravel. Compaction shall be by mechanical tamping in 8‑inch maximum loose lifts using mechanical or hand tampers, weighing not less than 20 pounds, or vibratory rollers. All other means must be approved in writing by the Engineer. All backfill shall be compacted to 98% of maximum laboratory dry density or 70 percent relative density. The material shall be within 2.0 percent of optimum moisture content.
   1. The Contractor may request approval of alternate means of compaction. Such request must be submitted to the Engineer in writing. Approval of the compaction method will be made by the Engineer only in writing. Use of specified or approved compaction methods does not relieve the Contractor from providing a completed project meeting the intent of this Specification.
   1. The Contractor, at his cost and option, may substitute Flow Fill for Common Backfill material in the backfill zone.

* 
	1. Maintenance of Backfill: All backfill shall be maintained in a satisfactory condition and all places showing signs of settlement shall be filled and maintained during the life of the Contract and for a period of one year following the date of final acceptance of all work performed under the Contract. When the Contractor discovers or is notified by the Engineer or the Owner that any backfill is not in compliance with the provisions of this Contract, the Contractor shall correct such condition at once. Any utilities and road surfacing damaged by such settlement shall be repaired by the Contractor to the Owner’s and Engineer’s satisfaction. In addition, the Contractor shall be responsible for the cost to the Owner of all claims for damages filed with the Court and actions brought against and said Owner for, and because of, such damage.
   1. UNSUITABLE MATERIALS:
      1. At locations where unstable or undesirable conditions are encountered and as designated by the Engineer, the Contractor shall excavate and dispose of excavated materials. This material shall be replaced with suitable materials from other project earthwork that will be placed and compacted according to the requirements of the item of work involved.
   1. SURFACE RESTORATION:
      1. 
* 
	
General
: Where pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalks, or other improved surfaces have been removed or damaged during the course of the work, such items shall be restored to a condition equal to that prior to removal, to the same elevation and alignment. The subgrade for all restored surfaces shall be thoroughly compacted by mechanical or hand tampers, weighing not less than 20 pounds, or vibratory rollers, or by other proposed means of compaction acceptable to the Engineer. Base course shall be added for bituminous pavement.
   1. Sod defined as densely grassed turf, which is removed shall be replaced with sod of the same quality, or the sod removed may be put back if it has been properly stored and remains in a healthy condition.

* 
	1. Street Improvements: Paving, curb and gutter, sidewalks or other street improvement removed or damaged during construction shall be replaced with the same type and dimensions of items removed or damaged and shall be equal to, and consistent with, the undisturbed portions of the improvements existing prior to the trench excavation. All concrete used in the restoration work shall be equal to the requirements of the Street or Highway Department having jurisdiction.
   1. CLEANUP:
      1. The Contractor shall final grade the structural and trench backfill to a smooth grade to effect a neat and workmanlike appearance. Boulders that cannot be placed in the trench backfill shall be collected and hauled to a dumpsite selected by the Contractor, off the Owner's property and easements.
   1. Excess excavated material, rubbish, and construction debris if any, shall be similarly hauled away to a licensed dumpsite location, off the easements and rights-of-way for this project. Alternately, the Contractor may haul this material to private property upon approval of the owner of that property and the Engineer.
   1. All tools, equipment of the work barricades and the Contractor shall remove temporary structures from the site. The construction site shall be left clean, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
