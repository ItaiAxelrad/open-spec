   1. QUALITY CONTROL
   1. Requirements of Regulatory Agencies
   1. Soil erosion and sedimentation control permit as may be required by the State of Colorado will be obtained by the Owner. Contractor must have a copy of the permit on site and comply with all requirements.
   1. Obtain a soil erosion and sedimentation control permit as may be required and pay all associated fees.
   1. Reference Specifications
   1. Colorado Water Quality Control Act, sections 25-8-501 through 505, C.R.S. as amended.
   1. DEFINITIONS
   1. Topsoil:
      1. Loose friable loam reasonably free of admixture of subsoil, refuse, stumps, soil sterilants, rocks, brush, weeds, all material 2" in diameter and larger and detrimental to proper development of vegetative growth.
   1. MATERIALS

General
   1. Provide materials as indicated on the Drawings, in compliance with Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control, subject to approval and modification by the Architect and the local enforcing agency.
   1. EXECUTION

General
   1. Comply with all requirements of the Colorado Water Quality Control Act. Minimum requirements are detailed in the Contract Documents. It is noted that the basic purpose of the referenced Act is to ensure that "Sediment caused by accelerated soil erosion...be removed from runoff water before it leaves the site of the earth change.". Where the following unanticipated events result in the need for additional or modified soil erosion and sedimentation control installations to meet the objective of the referenced Act, provide such installation on a timely basis:
      1. Unanticipated alterations to the Contract schedule when not dictated by the Owner.
   1. Unanticipated weather conditions, except unusual natural occurrences such as tornado, 50-year storm or fire.
   1. Install temporary erosion control measures as indicated on the Drawings as soon as possible after construction begins.
   1. Maintain all erosion and sedimentation controls until the Contract has been completed and accepted. Such maintenance includes:
      1. Repair of all damaged installations.
   1. Replacement of lost facilities.
   1. Periodic removal of collected silt and sedimentation as required or directed to maintain effectiveness of the silt traps, filters and basins.
   1. PREPARATION
   1. Cleaning and Grubbing
   1. Perform clearing and grubbing as indicated or as necessary to perform excavation, trenching, embankment, borrow, and other Work required, and where desired by Contractor for subsidiary purposes subject to approval.
   1. Clearing
   1. Includes felling and disposal of trees, brush, and other vegetation.
   1. Conduct Work in a manner to prevent damage to property and to provide for the safety of employees and others.
   1. Keep operations within property lines as indicated.
   1. Grubbing
   1. Includes removal and disposal of tree stumps and roots larger than 3 inches in diameter.
   1. Remove to a depth of at least 18 inches below existing grade elevation.
   1. Backfill all excavated depressions with approved material and grade to drain.
   1. Stripping
   1. Remove topsoil from areas within limits of excavation, trenching and borrow, and areas designated to receive embankment and compacted fill.
   1. Scrape areas clean of all brush, grass, weeds, roots, and other materials. Strip to depth of approximately 6 inches or to a sufficient depth to remove excessive roots in heavy vegetation or brush areas and as required to segregate topsoil.
   1. Stockpile topsoil in areas designated where it will not interfere with construction operations or existing facilities.
   1. Construct storage piles to freely drain surface water.
   1. Cover storage piles if required to prevent windblown dust. Comply with governmental regulations regarding control.
   1. Should stockpiled topsoil disappear, Contractor will be required to replace missing topsoil with topsoil meeting specified requirements. Dispose of extra stockpiled topsoil off site or as directed by Owner.
   1. Debris
   1. Dispose of debris from clearing, grubbing, stripping, and demolition at a location off the jobsite as arranged for by contractor or by burying on the site with approval.
   1. Place debris buried on the site a minimum of 5 feet below finished grade in areas acceptable to Owner. Indicate locations of buried debris on Contractor-furnished construction records.
   1. Contractor may claim and salvage any timber which he may consider of value, but shall not delay in any manner either this Contract or other Work with salvaging operations.
   1. CLEAN UP
   1. Remove temporary erosion control measures at the completion of construction, unless ordered by the Architect to remain in place. Take care during removal to minimize siltation of nearby drainage courses
