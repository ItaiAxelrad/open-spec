   1. Provide riprap downstream of apron endwalls at all storm drainage outfalls and at other locations as indicated on the drawings. 
1. CASTING INSTALLATION
1. *Note to the designer:* *Correctional and mental health facilities shall be provided with Security Castings. Verify casting models and locking or fastening features to be incorporated into manhole covers. If welded covers are required specify whether contractor or institution staff will weld manhole covers.*
   1. Install casting type as indicated on the drawings or in the specifications. *[Correctional and mental health facilities shall be provided with Security Castings.]*
   1. Provide butyl sealant material between last adjusting ring and casting base. Adjust casting elevation and slope to match adjacent proposed grades.
1. CONNECTIONS TO EXISTING STRUCTURES
   1. Make all necessary openings into existing structures or drainage pipes including the reconstruction of existing inverts or benches, as necessary. Patch all openings permanently watertight with concrete brick and mortar, hydraulic cement, or flexible watertight boots.
1. DRAINAGE LATERALS
1. *Note to the designer:
      1. If connecting lateral to storm drainage main owned by municipality or drainage district, verify connection requirements and modify this specification accordingly. A manhole may be required at the connection of a lateral greater than 6-inches in diameter to the storm drainage main.*** 
   1. Connect existing storm drainage laterals in accordance with all of the requirements of the storm drainage mains, including bedding, backfill, compaction, and jointing of the pipe. Connect drainage laterals to the storm drainage main by means of an approved "wye" fitting. Connect the new pipe to the existing lateral material using a no-hub coupling or approved transition fitting. Coupling/fitting shall be selected for the specific pipe material being connected. 
1. PIPE INSULATION
   1. Provide insulation where indicated on the drawings. 
   1. Install insulation on compacted utility cover material, 6” above the top of the pipe. Stagger joints where more than one layer of insulation is required. Provide insulation with a minimum of 1’ of utility cover material. Place cover and backfill material in manner that does not damage insulation; replace any damaged insulation. 
1. LOCATOR TAPE
   1. Install locator tape directly above new non-metallic storm sewer pipe approximately 15 inches below finished grade. Bring tape to surface and terminate in a drainage structure.
1. DEFLECTION TESTING** 
   1. Test all PVC and HDPE drainage pipe in the presence of the DFD Project Representative by a "go-no-go" deflection test mandrel furnished by the Contractor. Do not perform deflection testing any sooner than 30 days following the installation of the pipe. Pull the mandrel by hand, or hand operated winch so as to avoid any damages to the pipe that may be caused by mechanized pulling equipment.
   1. Size the mandrel to test the pipeline for a maximum allowable internal deflection of the pipe (in any direction) of not to exceed five (5) percent of the original internal diameter for the pipelines tested, regardless of how long after installation the testing takes place.
1. *Note to the designer:
      1. If televising is not required for the storm drainage pipes on this project remove the paragraph below.*

*[Deflection testing may be done concurrently with any necessary televising of the pipes. When done concurrently with televising, the mandrel may be pulled by mechanized equipment, provided the mandrel is visible in the television picture during the testing and the operation of the mandrel can be**quickly halted before damage to the pipe occurs.]*
   1. Where poor trench soils conditions require the pipe excavation to be undercut and/or over excavated, the Construction Representative reserves the right to require an additional deflection test prior to the expiration of the Contractor's one year performance guarantee.
   1. Remove and replace all pipe that fails to pass the five (5) percent vertical deflection testing until the pipe passes the deflection test.
1. LEAKAGE TESTING
   1. Storm sewers shall be visually inspected for excessive water infiltration and soil leakage into sewers or structures. Contractor shall repair/correct any infiltration or soil leakage that is considered excessive by the DFD Project Representative.
1. SEWER TELEVISING
   1. Note to the designer:
      1. If televising is not required for the storm drainage pipes on this project remove or edit the paragraph below.

*[Upon completion of the sewer construction all new sewers shall be televised to provide a record of the actual conditions inside the newly constructed sewers via closed circuit televising equipment. The DFD Project Representative may or may not be present during sewer inspections via this method.*

*Utilize televising equipment with a color camera specially designed and equipped for the conditions of the sewers to be televised, and with a monitor screen.* 

*Transport the camera equipment through the sewers by means of mechanical or hand operated winches, coordinated to provide speed and directional control necessary to fully observe the sewer interior. Provide a light source for the necessary illumination.*

*Provide televising equipment equipped with an on-screen distance meter, capable of registering distances in the sewer from the starting manhole, and accurate to the nearest 0.5’ station, so as to facilitate in the locating of sewer features and/or defects from the ground surface.*

*Provide televising equipment with an on-screen date and time clock, so as to permit the verification of the date and time of the television inspection.*

*All video files of the sewer inspection shall contain audio notes describing the sewer location, direction of inspection, and a description of any pertinent features observed during the televised inspection (service locations, leaking or faulty joints, debris in the line, offset joints, etc.). In addition, record this information on a written log or record, in a format of the Contractor's choosing.*

*The Contractor shall provide to the DFD Project Representative with 2 DVD copies of the CCTV inspection videos and all inspection forms.]*
1. ABANDON SEWER
   1. Where indicated on the drawings, existing sewer to be left in place shall be abandoned in accordance with Section 3.2.24 of the SSSWC. Sewer shall not be abandoned until existing laterals have been reconnected to the replacement sewer. Abandoning sewers is considered incidental to the construction.
