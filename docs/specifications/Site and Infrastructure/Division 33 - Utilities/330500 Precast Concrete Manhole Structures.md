         1. section 33 05 00
   1. precast concrete manhole structures

General

* 
	1. **Summary
   1. Work under this section shall include manholes for wastewater and water system specialty valves or meters, and other installations when specifically called out. 
	1. **Quality Assurance
2. Work shall meet Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment requirements for installations of wastewater and potable water systems.
3. The Contractor shall guarantee all water and wastewater manholes to be leak free for one year from the date of substantial completion of the entire project, or for two years if the Owner elects to require an extended warranty because of low spring runoff conditions.
	1. **Submittals
4. See Specification Section 01 33 00 for requirements for the mechanics and administration of the submittal process.
5. Shop drawings are required for the work in this section unless waived by the Engineer. 
	1. **Product Delivery, Storage and Handling
6. Pre-cast units shall be carefully handled and stored so that the concrete does not crack and the joints are not damaged, which shall be cause for rejection.
   ## Product

* 
	1. **Materials
   1. Manholes:
	1. Concrete: Per ASTM C 478. 4,000 psi with a minimum of 470 pounds of Type II Portland Cement per cubic yard of concrete, and a water cement ratio not to exceed 0.53.
	2. Base, Riser, and Conical Top Sections: Per ASTM C 478. The Conical top section shall have a 24-inch diameter access opening at its top. The base, riser, and bottom of the conical top section shall be 48-inch inside diameter unless called out otherwise on the plans or in the Special Provisions. Pre-cast base slabs or floors shall have a minimum thickness or 6-inches for 48-inch diameter risers and 8-inches for larger diameter risers.
	3. Flat Slab Tops: Per ASTM C 478. Access opening shall be 24-inch diameter. Minimum slab thickness 6-inch for risers up to 48-inch diameter, and 8-inch for larger riser diameters. Design for H-20 live load, and dead load based upon the amount and type of fill to be placed on the slab and the weight of the riser supported by the slab.
	4. Grade Rings: Pre-cast concrete. Per ASTM C 478.
	5. Joint and Joint Sealant:
		1. Between Manhole Sections to Include Pre-case Base Riser, Conical Sections, And Flat Slab Tops.
		2. Per ASTM C 478 made with male and female ends and sealed with RUB’R-NEK or equal flexible gasket-type sealant of partially vulcanized butyl rubber per Federal Specification SS-S-210A. Two gaskets are required per joint. Gasket size shall be as recommended by the manufacturer based upon the annular space to be sealed. If the minimum cross sectional area equivalent of the gasket is less than one-inch diameter, confirm suitability with Engineer before proceeding.
		3. Between Cast-in-place Base and Riser. Flat bottom riser placed on a flat formed base and sealed with two flexible gaskets per (a) above.
		4. Pipe To Manhole Seal:
			1. Pre-cast Base: Flexible rubber boot in a cored hole per ASTM C 923. Connectors shall be KOR-N-Seal, A-Lok or approved equal.
			2. Cast-in-place Base: Two elastomeric seals minimum per pipe (O ring water stops) per ASTM F477.
		5. Between Grade Rings, and Between Flat Slab Top or Conical Section and Grade Rings.
			1. Bed in mortar and point with mortar.
		6. Between Cast Iron Frame and Concrete Surfaces.
			1. RUB’R-NEK or equal flexible gasket-type sealant of partially vulcanized butyl rubber per Federal Specification SS-S-210A. One gasket with a minimum cross sectional area equivalent to one inch in diameter is required per joint.
	6. Waterproof lids shall be Neenah “Self-sealing” lids.
	7. Adjusting Rings (Extension Rings): Gray cast iron, ASTM A 48, Class 25, Neenah R-1979-0141 (1½”) or R-1979-0143 (2”) or equal to match lid opening.
	8. Exterior coating: THOROSEAL Foundation Coating or equal.
	9. Grout: Non-shrink, non-metallic either cement or epoxy based as recommended by the manufacturer for the application.
	10. Mortar: Masonry cement per ASTM C91. 
	11. Overflow float:
		1. Manhole shall include overflow floatation device.


## Execution

1. 3.1 General
   1. Manholes shall be installed level and plumb. 
1. 3.2 Installation
   1. Bases:
	1. Pre-cast Bases: Install pre-cast bases unless specific connection requirements dictate a cast-in-place structure or authorized by Mount Werner Water.
	2. Cast-in-Place Bases: The use of cast-in-place bases must be authorized by the Engineer prior to installation.
	3. Cure cast-in-place base for a minimum of 24 hours at no less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit prior to placement of pre-cast rings. Provide insulation for curing whenever the temperature is less than 45 degrees.
2. Flat Slab Tops:
      1. Substitute a riser section and flat slab top for the cone section in all manholes where the vertical distance between the top of the cone section and invert is 5 feet or less.
3. Grade Rings:
      1. A maximum of 6 vertical inches of grade rings may be installed to bring the frame and lid to final elevation. 
4. Install overflow device per Manufacturer’s installation instructions.
