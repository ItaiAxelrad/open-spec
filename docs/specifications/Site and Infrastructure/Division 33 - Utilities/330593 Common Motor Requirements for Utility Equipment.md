   1. Electrical drawings and/or specifications show number and horsepower rating of all motors furnished by this Contractor, together with their actuating devices if these devices are furnished by the Electrical Contractor. Should any discrepancy in size, horsepower rating, electrical characteristics or means of control be found for any motor or other electrical equipment after contracts are awarded, Contractor is to immediately notify the architect/engineer of such discrepancy. Costs involved in any changes required due to equipment substitutions initiated by this contractor will be the responsibility of this contractor.
1. *The intent of the preceding paragraph is to indicate motor horsepower in one location only and to coordinate this information before bids are received. It is not the intent to have the Contractor become responsible for last minute motor size changes made by the consultant. If a contractor uses one of the listed manufacturers for a piece of equipment, DFD would not consider that a change initiated by the contractor. Follow DFD guidelines and good design practice when selecting motors for electrically driven equipment and coordinate this information before bidding documents are issued.*

1. *Delete the larger size motors from this table if they are not needed on the project.*
1. SINGLE PHASE, SINGLE SPEED MOTORS
   1. Use NEMA rated 115 volt, single phase, 60 hertz motors for all motors 1/3 HP and smaller.
   1. Use permanent split capacitor or capacitor start, induction run motors equipped with permanently lubricated and sealed ball or sleeve bearings and Class A insulation. Service factor to be not less than 1.35.
1. *Many fractional horsepower motors have inherent overtemperature protection. When this is the case, manual starters or relays may be used rather than magnetic starters with overload protection. Coordinate with the electrical design consultant****.*
1. MOTORS USED FOR REDUCED VOLTAGE STARTING
   1. Furnish motors compatible with reduced voltage starting for the following motors:
    1. Equipment Starter Type
1. *This paragraph requires careful coordination with the local utility company requirements and the electrical design consultant. It must be edited and expanded specifically for each project. As a general guide only, 200 volt or 230 volt motors over 20 hp and 460 volt motors over 50 hp may need some means of limiting the inrush current on startup.*
1. MOTORS USED ON VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES
   1. In addition to the requirements specified above, the motor must be suitable for use with the drive specified in Section 23 05 14, including but not limited to motor cooling.
1. P A R T 3 - E X E C U T I O N
1. INSTALLATION
   1. Mount motors on a rigid base designed to accept a motor, using shims if required under each mounting foot to get a secure installation.
   1. When motor will be flexible coupled to the driven device, mount coupling to the shafts in accordance with the coupling manufacturer's recommendations. Check parallel and angular misalignment of the two shafts. Adjust motor position as necessary so that the misalignment of the shafts does not exceed the limits in the table:
      1. RPM

   1. When motor will be connected to the driven device by means of a belt drive, mount sheaves on the appropriate shafts in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Use a straight edge to check alignment of the sheaves; reposition sheaves as necessary so that the straight edge contacts both sheave faces squarely. Misalignment on V-belt drives should be less than 0.1” per foot of center distance. Misalignment for synchronous belts should be less than 0.0625” per foot of center distance. After sheaves are aligned, loosen the adjustable motor base so that the belt(s) can be added and tighten the base so that the belt tension is in accordance with the drive manufacturer's recommendations. Frequently recheck belt tension and adjust if necessary during the first day of operation and again after 80 hours of operation.
   1. Verify the proper rotation of each three-phase motor as it is being wired or before the motor is energized for any reason.
   1. Lubricate all motors requiring lubrication. Record lubrication material used and the frequency of use. Include this information in the maintenance manuals.
