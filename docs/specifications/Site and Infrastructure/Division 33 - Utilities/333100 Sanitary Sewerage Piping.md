Execution

* 
	1. **Pipe Installation

General

: Pipe placement shall conform to manufacturer’s recommendations. Materials shall not be dropped into the trench but shall be lowered by either hand or machine. Pipe laying shall proceed upgrade with the spigot ends of bell-and-spigot pipe pointing in the direction of flow.
	1. The entire surface of all pipes shall be clean when laid. Interior surfaces of pipe sockets shall be cleaned when the pipe is laid and the joints completed. No debris, tools, clothing or other material shall be placed in the pipe. When pipe laying operations are not being conducted or are temporarily suspended, all pipe openings are to be plugged with an appropriate size wastewater plug. Pipes not making a good fit shall be removed from the job site
	2. Field cut sections of pipe shall only be used for making connections to manholes, other structures or existing pipelines when makeup piping is needed to make the closure.
	3. Each pipe shall be laid true to line and grade to form a tight concentric joint with the adjoining pipe and to prevent sudden offsets to the flow line. Pipe grade shall be uniform between manholes. No pipes are to be placed in the trench or final joints made, until unstable trench bottoms have been stabilized and fine grading of the trench bottom to accommodate the pipe invert has been completed. Immediate partial backfill may be required to prevent accidental deflection of the pipe.
	4. State Health regulations require that wastewater mains be installed at a 10-foot minimum clear horizontal distance from potable water mains. If this separation cannot be maintained consult with the Engineer for any special precautions that may be required.
	5. When authorized to connect new pipe to an existing plain end pipe use an approved transition coupling tightened to a watertight fit. No Fernco or Caulder couplings are allowed.
	6. **Cleanout Installation

   1. Cleanout structures shall be located and constructed as shown in the Drawings, or as directed by the Engineer or District. The cleanout shall have a true and smooth interior to allow easy access for inspection lights, plugs, and cleaning equipment.
2. Cleanouts shall be installed at intervals not to exceed one hundred (100) feet in straight runs and for each aggregate horizontal change in direction exceeding one hundred thirty-five (135) degrees. Sizing locations and installation shall be in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC).
3. Final grade of the cleanout cover shall be as specified for manhole lids.
	1. **Quality Control
4. General:
      1. Test pipe line promptly after installation through completion of backfill. No more than 800-feet shall be installed without testing the completed portions.
5. Lamping:
      1. Alignment, grade and pipe condition may be checked by the Engineer. A light will be flashed between manholes by means of reflecting sunlight with a mirror. Proper alignment shall consist of a “full moon” clearly visible at the opposite and of the line from the observer’s location.
	1. No more than 48 hours prior to the lamping test, the Contractor shall put water in the upper section of the line and let it flow out through the new lines and manholes. During the lamping tests, the Engineer shall check for standing water indicating sags or settled sections of pipe or manholes. The maximum amount of standing water allowed in any pipe or manhole shall be 3 percent of the pipe’s diameter or 1/2 inch whichever is smaller.
	2. The Contractor shall correct any deficiencies noted such as poor alignment, displaced pipe, debris in the pipe, or any other defects. Tests will be repeated after completion of repair and backfill.
6. Leakage:
      1. After lamping tests are completed, testing for water tightness shall be completed by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer.
	1. Air test: The Contractor must test wastewater mains by means of an air test. The Contractor’s testing procedure and equipment shall be approved by the Engineer prior to proceeding. All lines shall be pressurized in the Engineer’s presence and all pressurized lines shall have the pressure released in the Engineer’s presence. Gauges used to monitor the air test and fill and drain lines shall be located above grade not in the manhole.
	2. The length of time for a 0.5 psig pressure drop from 3.5 psig to 3.0 psig shall not be less than the following table:

   1. The Contractor shall locate and repair the defective joints or pipe in every section of line which fails the air test. The Contractor shall retest the line until the line passes the test.

   1. Deflection:
      1. The maximum allowable pipe deflection is 5 percent of the pipe diameter.
2. Deflection testing may be required if the Engineer suspects excessive pipe deflection or if the Contractor’s pipe bedding procedures, in particular, tamping and compaction of the bedding, are questionable in the opinion of the Engineer.
	1. The deflection test will be performed by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer. The test shall be conducted by pulling a 5 percent deflection mandrel through the pipe. If the mandrel does not pass a point between manholes A and B when being pulled from A to B, the mandrel will be pulled from B to A.
	2. The Contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment to include deflection mandrels and a water truck if necessary. 
	3. If areas of greater than 5 percent deflection are encountered, the Engineer may require that the deflection test be repeated with a 7 percent deflection mandrill or require excavation of the line in the area of excessive deflection to determine the cause. All areas of excess deflection shall be corrected by the Contractor at his expense.
3. Video Inspection:
      1. Shall be required for all sewer mains, for both publicly accepted and privately owned.
	1. Video inspection of all mains will be performed by a qualified contractor.
	2. No more than 48 hours prior to the video inspection, the contractor shall clean and flush all new sewer mains and manholes.
	3. The video inspection must be performed with a color video camera which is track driven and sits on the bottom of the pipe for proper orientation and shall have an articulating camera to allow for inspection of service taps.
	4. The video must be with encoded distance totalizer, from and to manhole numbers, pipe material, size and inspection date. 
	5. The video log shall include:
		1. Date of inspection
		2. Operator
		3. Project name
		4. Pipe material
		5. Pipe length (edge of manhole to edge of manhole)
		6. Pipe diameter
		7. Joint spacing
		8. Year installed
		9. From and To manhole numbers
		10. Manhole depth
		11. Direction of inspection (upstream or downstream)
		12. Location, direction (east, west, north, south) and orientation (10 o’clock, 2 o’clock) of service taps
		13. Observed defects
		14. A scalable map of the project limits bound into the video log. The map shall include the location of all manholes and sewer mains within the project limits. All manholes shall be numbered per Mount Werner Water numbering system.
	6. The maximum amount of standing water allowed in any pipe or manhole shall be 3 percent of the pipe’s diameter or 1/2 inch whichever is smaller.
