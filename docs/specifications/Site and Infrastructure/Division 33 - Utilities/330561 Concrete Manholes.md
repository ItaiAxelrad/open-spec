   1. PRODUCTS
   1. PRECAST SECTIONS:
    1. Manhole bases, barrels and cones shall be of precast construction in conformance with CDOT Standard Specifications Section 712.05 and Standard Plan No. M-604-20. Shop drawings of the precast manhole bases shall be submitted by the Contractor for review and approval by the Project Engineer prior to being ordered. Manhole cones and flat-top lids shall be eccentric.
   1. Cast In Place Bases will be allowed in accordance with CDOT M Standard M-604-20.
   1. FRAMES, GRATES, COVERS, STEPS:
      1. Manhole frames, grates, covers, and steps shall be in accordance with CDOT Standard Specifications Section 712.06 and Standard Plan No. M-604-20. Covers shall be furnished with the appropriate wording cast on the cover as directed by the Project Engineer.
   1. MORTAR:
      1. Mortar used in repair of precast sections shall be composed of one part Portland Cement, and not more than three, nor less than two, parts of fine aggregate. Hydrated lime or masonry cement shall not be used. Portland Cement shall meet the requirements of ASTM C-150, Type II. Fine aggregate shall consist of well-graded natural sand having clean, hard, durable, uncoated grains, free from organic matter, soft or flaky fragments or other deleterious substances. The fine aggregate shall be thoroughly washed and shall be uniformly graded from coarse to fine with a minimum of 95% passing a No. 4 sieve and a maximum of seven percent 7% passing a No. 100 sieve.
   1. JOINT SEALING COMPOUND :
      1. Joints between manhole sections shall be sealed with a flexible joint compound. Joint seal shall be "RAMNEK" or "RUBBERNEK" or an approved equal. The application of priming compound and sealing compound shall be performed in strict conformance with the manufacturer's instruction as to quantity of material, the grade of the materials, and the application temperatures. The compound shall be applied to all manhole joints.
   1. EXECUTION
   1. CONSTRUCTION
   1. Manholes shall be constructed at the locations and to the grades identified on the Plans and shall be so constructed as to form a circle in a horizontal plane. The manhole barrels shall be tight at all joints. CDOT M Standard M-604-20 shall be used for Storm Manholes.
   1. Precast concrete adjustment rings (grade rings) shall be used on top of the cone or flat-top lid to support and adjust the manhole frame to the required final grade. Maximum depth of adjustment rings shall be such that there is not more than 18 inches between manhole steps. Precast adjustment rings and manhole frames shall be grouted in place. Concrete collars poured at final grade around manhole frames shall be prohibited so as to prevent any interference with the proposed surface treatment in the vicinity of the manhole.
   1. PIPE PENETRATIONS:
      1. Precast manhole sections shall be furnished with knockouts for pipe penetrations that provide a void space around the penetrating pipe large enough to facilitate continuous grouting around the pipe in its final position with non-shrink grout.
   1. CHANNELIZATION OF FLOW IN BASE:
      1. Channelization of pipe flow through the manhole base shall be made with unreinforced cast-in-place Class B concrete in conformance with CDOT Standard Plan No. M-604-20.
   1. MARKER POSTS:
      1. Marker posts shall be installed at all storm sewer manholes not located in paved, graveled, or lawn areas.
