General
   1. Prevent runoff from adjacent pervious and impervious surfaces from
entering the bioretention facility (e.g., sand bag inlet curb cuts, stabilize
   1. adjacent areas, flow diversion) until authorization is given by the
   1. Engineer/Landscape Architect. Refer to SFPUC Specification
   1. Section 01 57 29 Temporary Protection of Green Infrastructure Facilities.
   1. Exclude equipment from bioretention facilities. B. No equipment shall operate
   1. within the facility once bioretention facility excavation has begun, including
   1. during and after excavation, backfilling, mulching, or planting.
   1. Prevent foreign materials and substances, such as silt laden run-off,
construction debris, paint, paint washout, concrete slurry, concrete layers or
   1. chunks, cement, plaster, oils, gasoline, diesel fuel, paint thinner, turpentine,
   1. tar, roofing compound, or acid from entering or being stored in the facility at
   1. any point during construction.
02. GRADING
   1. The Contractor shall not start bioretention facility grading until all areas
draining to the facility are stabilized and authorization has been given by the

   1. 1/2 inch of precipitation within the previous 48 hours.
03. SUBGRADE PREPARATION AND PROTECTION
   1. Protect the bioretention excavation from over compaction and/or
contamination.
1.** Areas which have been over compacted by equipment or vehicle
   1. traffic or by other means and which need to be ripped, over
   1. excavated, receive additional scarification, or other restorative means
   1. shall be done at the Contractor’s expense and at the direction of the
   1. Engineer/Landscape Architect.
1. 2.** Excavated areas contaminated by sediment laden runoff prior to
   1. placement of BSM or Aggregate Storage material shall be remediated
   1. at the Contractor’s expense by removing the contaminated soil (top
   1. 3 inches minimum) and replacing with a suitable material, as
   1. determined by the Engineer/Landscape Architect.
   1. Remove all trash, debris, construction waste, cement dust and/or slurry, or
any other materials that may impede infiltration into prepared subgrade.
   1. The subgrade shall be inspected and accepted by the Engineer/Landscape
Architect prior to placement of any materials or final subgrade scarification.
   1. Scarify the surface of the subgrade to a minimum depth of 3 inches
immediately prior to placement of BSM or aggregate storage material.

   1. Aggregate Storage areas contaminated by sediment-laden runoff prior to
placement of BSM shall be remediated at the Contractor’s expense by
   1. removing the contaminated aggregate storage material (top 3 inches
   1. minimum or as directed by the Engineer/Landscape Architect) and
   1. replacing with clean aggregate storage material per Section 2.03, to the
   1. lines and grades on the Plans.
   1. Aggregate Storage material shall be inspected and accepted for placement
and finish grade by the Engineer/Landscape Architect prior to the
   1. installation of BSM. Any material that does not conform to this Specification
   1. shall be removed and replaced with acceptable material or remediated to
   1. the satisfaction of the Engineer/Landscape Architect, at the Contractor’s
   1. expense.
04. BIORETENTION SOIL MIX PLACEMENT
   1. The Contractor shall not place BSM until the Engineer/Landscape Architect
has reviewed and confirmed the following:
   1.** BSM delivery ticket(s):
      1. Delivery tickets shall show that the full
   1. delivered amount of BSM matches the product type, volume and
   1. manufacturer named in the submittals. Each delivered batch of BSM
   1. shall be accompanied by a certification letter from the supplier
   1. verifying that the material meets specifications and is supplied from
   1. the approved BSM stockpile.
1. 2.** Visual match with submitted samples:
      1. Delivered product will be
   1. compared to the submitted 1-gallon sample, to verify that it matches
   1. the submitted sample. The Engineer/Landscape Architect may inspect
   1. any loads of BSM on delivery and stop placement if the soil does not
   1. appear to match the submittals; and require sampling and testing of
   1. the delivered soil to determine if the soil meets the requirements of
   1. Section 2.01 before authorizing soil placement.
1. 3.** Inspection of the aggregate storage layer, underdrain, cleanout, and
   1. overflow structure installation, where included on the plans.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to require that
   1. the testing specified in Section 2.01 be performed on samples taken at the
   1. supplier’s yard from the stockpile to be used for the project; see designer
   1. note in Section 1.06.C.2.
   1. BSM placement, grading and consolidation shall not occur when the BSM is
excessively wet, or has been subjected to more than 1/2 inch of
   1. precipitation within 48 hours prior to placement. Excessively wet is defined
   1. as being at or above 22 percent soil moisture by a General Tools &
   1. Instruments DSMM500 Precision Digital Soil Moisture Meter with Probe (or
   1. equivalent). A minimum of three readings with the soil moisture probe will
   1. be used to determine the average percent soil moisture reading per each
   1. truck load. There should be no visible free water in the material.
   1. The Contractor shall place BSM loosely with a conveyor C. belt or with an
   1. excavator or loader from a height no higher than 6 feet, unless otherwise
   1. approved by the Engineer/Landscape Architect (i.e., do not dump material
   1. directly from truck into cell). Soil shall be placed upon a prepared subgrade
   1. in accordance with these Specifications and in conformity with the lines,
   1. grades, depth, and typical cross-section shown in the Drawings or as
   1. established by the Engineer/Landscape Architect.
   1. Excessively dry BSM may be lightly and uniformly moistened, as
necessary, to facilitate placement and workability.
   1. Compact BSM using non-mechanical compaction methods (e.g., boot
packing, hand tamping, or water consolidation) to 83 percent (+/- 2 percent)
   1. of the maximum dry density per modified Proctor test (ASTM D1557), or as
   1. directed by the Geotechnical Engineer. Determination of in-place density
   1. shall be made using a nuclear gauge per ASTM D6938. Moisture content
   1. determination shall be conducted on a soil sample taken at the location of
   1. the nuclear gage reading per ASTM D2216.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. BSM compaction target density will be updated as more
   1. data from installed projects becomes available on the optimal compaction to
   1. minimize settlement while maintaining the infiltration capacity of the media.
   1. Designers are encouraged to report field density measurements, observed
   1. infiltration rates (if available), and anecdotal field observations (e.g., soil
   1. appears well draining, settlement observed minimal).
   1. Grade BSM to a smooth, uniform surface plane with loose, uniformly fine
      1. Rake, remove ridges, and fill depressions to meet finish grades.
   1. Final soil depth shall be measured and verified only after the soil has been
      1. If after consolidation, the soil is not within +/- 3/4 inch of the
grades and slopes specified on the Plans, add material to bring it up to final
   1. grade and raked.
   1. The BSM shall be inspected and accepted for placement and finish grade
by the Engineer/Landscape Architect prior to the installation of planting and
      1. Any BSM that does not conform to this Specification shall be
remediated to the satisfaction of the Engineer/Landscape Architect, or
   1. removed and replaced with acceptable BSM, at the Contractor’s expense.
05. PLANTING AND MULCHING
   1. Bioretention facilities shall be planted and mulched as shown on the Plans.
   1. Bioretention facilities shall not be planted or mulched when soils are
excessively wet as defined in Section 3.04.
   1. Bioretention facility areas contaminated by sediment C. laden runoff prior to
   1. planting or placement of mulch shall be remediated at the Contractor’s
   1. expense by removing the contaminated BSM (top 3 inches minimum) and
   1. replacing with BSM per Section 2.01, to the lines and grades on the Plans.
   1. All mulch shall be inspected and accepted by the Engineer/Landscape
Architect to ensure appropriate depth and material prior to facility
   1. commissioning (e.g., unblocking of inlets).
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Planting and mulching requirements shall be determined by
   1. the designer and included or referenced herein.
06. FLOOD TESTING
   1. Inlets shall be constructed per the Plans and free from all obstructions prior
to commencing flow testing.
   1. Testing shall be conducted at the conclusion of the 90-day plant grow-in
      1. Protection and flow diversion measures installed to comply with
Section 01 57 29 Temp Protection of GI Facilities shall be removed in their
   1. entirety prior to commencing flow testing.
   1. Underdrains shall be plugged at the outlet structure to minimize water
consumption during testing.
   1. Prior to testing, broom sweep gutter and other impervious surfaces within
the test area to remove sediments and other objectionable materials.
   1. The Engineer/Landscape Architect shall be present during the
      1. The Contractor shall notify the Engineer/Landscape
Architect a minimum of 2 working days prior to testing.
   1. The Contractor shall water test each facility to demonstrate that all inlet
curb openings are capturing and diverting all water in the gutter to the
   1. facility, outlet structures are engaging at the elevation specified, and the
   1. designed ponding depth is achieved. Testing shall include application of
   1. water from a hydrant or water truck per Section 00 73 73, Article 3.04

(Requirements for Using Water For Construction), at a minimum rate of
   1. 10 gallons per minute, into the gutter a minimum of 15 feet upstream of the
   1. inlet curb opening being tested. Each inlet shall be tested individually. If
   1. erosion occurs during testing, restore soils, plants, and other affected
   1. materials.
   1. DESIGNER NOTE:
      1. Designer should update test flow rate for inlets to reflect
   1. project-specific design, as needed.
   1. Engineer/Landscape Architect will identify deficiencies and required
corrections, including but not limited to relocating misplaced plants,
   1. adjusting streambed gravel, adjusting mulch, adjusting inlets, splash
   1. aprons, and forebays, removing and replacing inlets, and removing debris.
