1. ERECTION, INSTALLATION AND APPLICATION
   1. Tracer wire is required on Gas, Telephone/Communication (telecom), Water, and Sanitary Sewer.
   1. Marker tape 1’ below surface is required on all underground utilities.
   1. Marker balls shall be placed a minimum of 4” directly above utility pipe. If the utility pipe is deeper than 5’ contractor shall place the marker balls 5’ below the surface.

 
   1. Where necessary, marker balls shall be secured to the utility by inserting a cable tie through the marker ball tie-down tabs and around the utility pipe.
   1. Once the marker has been placed, hand-fill at least 6”of soil over the marker. Continue normal backfill operations once hand-filling is complete.
   1. Intermediate marker balls shall be utilized on straight runs of pipe. These balls do not require any ID marker information. Intermediate marker balls will be placed every 50’ unless directed otherwise.
   1. Marker ID balls shall be placed as identified below:
      1. At all bends 22.5º or higher
   1. At capped or plugged ends
   1. At tees
   1. Program each marker ID ball with NREL Marker Number. NREL shall provide the starting sequence number for the installation. Marker number sequence will follow the general guideline shown below:
